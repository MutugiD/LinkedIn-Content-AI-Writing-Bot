This is a story about taking risks and never giving up. I faced a lot of rejection when I left Uber, but I didnâ€™t let that stop me. I put myself out there to 12 companies as a consultant, and while 11 of them rejected me, one was interested. I didn't know what I was doing, so I made up a pitch, which included an absurdly high rate of $287 / hr. Miraculously, they countered with an incredible offer of $250/hr for 25 hours per week. This story shows that even if people tell you something is impossible, it might just be possible when you put yourself out there and take a chance.
