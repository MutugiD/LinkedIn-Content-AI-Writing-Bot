Can you consult part-time as an Operations expert? 
  
  Yes, but there's a catch. 
  
  The catch is, nobody knows what  Operations  really means. 
  
  So you need to completely change your phrasing for how you talk about this. 
  
  What do I mean? 
  
  Let's take an example.  
  
  I did Operations and launch at Uber for 4 years. But when I pitch myself, I pitch myself as  a specialist in launching and scaling two and three-sided, B2B and B2C marketplaces for early-stage start-ups. 
  
  Now you have an idea what I actually do, and if I'm relevant to your company. 
  
  Does this niche me down and eliminate a lot of companies? Yes. But what it also does is tell those two and three-sided marketplaces that I'm the right fit for them. Which is what you want.  
  
  If you go to a company and tell them you're a  swiss army knife that can do a little bit of everything  what they're hearing is  cool you seem smart but I have no idea how you can help me  and odds are, the conversation dies quickly. 
  
  Your job is in ONE sentence to communicate your value-add.  
  
  And then, you can be an expert, part-time  Operations  consultant.
