STORY:
================================

You:  I just don't know if my experience is really that valuable or if I can consult in my area of expertise. 
  
  CEO of Seed company:  Can you give me some insight into how you scaled Uber Eats in 5 different markets? 
  
  You:  Of course, let me share the playbook with you and help you avoid 10,000 mistakes. 
  
  CEO of Seed company:  Holy s*** you just saved me a ton of trial and error, and by executing this playbook, we can raise our Series A! 
  
  You now: Not charging enough, not valuing your experience, having imposter thoughts, and wondering if you can do it. 
  
  You soon: Flexible work, charging based on the value you provide, winning monthly retainers, no BS politics, enjoying the people you work with, having free time and flexibility in your work life, and making more than you did in a full-time W2 job. 
  
  Don't undervalue your experience. Please.  
  
  Sincerely, 
  Bradley and Mylance

Don't sell yourself short. With the right experience and knowledge, you can achieve far more than you could imagine.

This serves as a reminder that if you value yourself and remain confident in your abilities, then dramatic results—from achieving more flexible work, to monthly retainers and more—can be obtained.
