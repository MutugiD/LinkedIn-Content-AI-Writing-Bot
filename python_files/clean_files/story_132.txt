“cold outreach dead.” i’m seeing everywhere, yet responded cold outreach linkedin yesterday. made respond? two things really well: 1. language spoke me. resonated “pain” i’m feeling. maybe it’s good guess. think he’s done research, knows niche ideal client, thus used words founders used past. 2. validated past work. showcased experience i’d benefit would excited hear about. responded, booked call. don’t know i’ll end working him, got attention, lead consulting business. cold outreach isn’t dead. bar higher.
