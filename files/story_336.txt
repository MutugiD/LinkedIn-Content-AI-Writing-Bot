Clients love to try to get you to work for free. You jump on an intro call and your goal is to validate yourself so they hire you. You do so by sharing insights into a problem they're having, or an experience you had in the past.  
  
  They're taking vigorous notes - they're learning from you! The problem arises when it keeps happening. They ask for another call. They ask you to jump on a customer call. They ask for a  sample go to market strategy for X product.  Where do you draw the line between validating yourself, and working for free? 
  
  My general rule of thumb is two 30 min intro calls max, and then I'm done sharing free information. I say  I'm happy to continue the conversation and use my experience to help your company. Let's come up with a formal arrangement, and I'll be happy to tell you everything you'd like to know. 
  
  I've never gotten push-back to this sentence, and it has helped me closed multiple clients. If they aren't willing to get a formal arrangement in place, then I walk away.  
  
  Lastly, it's worth your time to write up a sample case-study that you can send to prospective clients. You spend the time to create it one time, and then can use it dozens of times without extra work. It showcases the value you add without long calls or extra free work. 
  
  Thoughts? How do you avoid working for free?
