As a new consultant 4 years ago, I made a ton of mistakes. But I learned a lot and built a 6-figure consulting business.  
  
  From that, and working with hundreds of others to grow their consulting businesses, here are my top 5 learnings: 
  
  1. Clients have incredibly short attention spans. If you can’t get across what value you add and capture their attention in the first 60 seconds of your intro, you’ve lost them. Have a very polished and concise niche and verbal intro 
  
  2. Iteration on your niche is an ongoing experiment until you learn what works. I started to pay a ton of attention to what I said that would “capture” someone’s attention, and then use that going forward with others 
  
  3. The way to win a client on the phone is by asking very thoughtful and curious questions about their business in the area you’re an expert. You validate yourself while learning about their business so when the proposal stage comes, you’re very well equipped for them to say “wow, we need to hire this guy.” 
  
  4. In a negotiation, information is power. The more you learn, the better you do. Ask questions. Be curious. Anchor high, and don’t be afraid to ask for really big numbers. Seek out a “no” so you know you asked high enough. If and when they say “no,” do not negotiate against yourself. Ask for them to counter. 
  
  5. Set very clear boundaries with your client for the work you’ll be doing, and when you’ll be available. Do not just do everything they ask. They’ll take advantage of your time and you’ll work way more than you set out to. 
  
  Ok and a bonus sixth: pricing yourself is not about how many hours you’ll put in. It’s about the value you create to the client. If you create $50k per month in value in 2 hours per month, that’s great and you should get paid for that. The client is paying for years of learning, skill development, experiences, and expensive education. They’re not paying for 2 hours. They’re paying for years of development.
