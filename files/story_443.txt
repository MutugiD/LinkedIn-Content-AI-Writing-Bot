Today I had a seamless, easy sales call. A call where every question the potential customer had, our solution solves it for them.  
    
  So far, building a business for me has been all about listening to customer problems, creating solutions for them, and executing well on those solutions.  
  
  When you do that well, your  sales  calls turn into just a conversation, and often an easy one. 
  
  I can't recommend it strongly enough: listen to your customers and then listen some more. Build what they want, and  selling  will be the least of your concerns
