I have been making career decisions for many years now, and this New Year brings the same dilemma; work in a corporate environment or pursue a more independent route? During my stint in Uber, I was able to bring home an annual salary of 180K and worked hard for 65 hours per week to make $56 per hour. As a consultant, I was able to earn 310K annually with only 30 hours of work each week and a higher rate of $210 an hour. Whether or not you'll take the corporate or more independent route is a decision to be made ultimately by you.
