STORY:
================================

What do I want to do with my professional life?  
  
  In making the decision to leave Uber, this is the question I wanted to answer.  
  
  Today, I feel lucky to be where I am, but it wasn’t by accident. Once I left Uber, I knew I wanted to do something on my own, I just wasn’t sure what. I asked a few start-ups if I could help them part-time, and all of a sudden I was a freelancer. I quickly learned I could make great money working part-time, while I still answered the question, “what do I want to do with my life?” 
  
  For me, having that time and space to explore that question, while still making money and adding value to companies was crucial. It allowed me to test different start-up ideas, and explore what being a founder would be like. It allowed me to help others with their freelancing journey, and eventually led me to start Mylance. 
  
  For me, becoming a freelancer allowed me to explore different ideas, in addition to giving me some much needed time away from work. What do you get out of freelancing? More efficient use of your time? Higher paying projects? Time and space for a passion? Fund your next company? Comment below!
