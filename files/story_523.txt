I loved working at Uber. I loved the people, the mission, the opportunity, and the growth. It was hard, but it was life changing. 
  
  But I wasn't fulfilled anymore. I was frustrated. I felt I'd reached my ceiling. I didn't feel fully valued for my work anymore. And more importantly, I was ready to work for myself.  
  
  So I quit. Because I saw what I was capable of doing. And I wanted to do that for myself, not for someone else. I was sick of making someone else rich. 
  
  My work at Uber gave me the belief in myself. Then, I took the leap. And I invested in myself. 
  
  I bought courses. I hired a coach. I went to therapy. I sought out mentors.  
  
  I bought a tiny Ecommerce business and learned what it was like to run that. I automated the backend and sold it for 4x what I bought it for. 
  
  I started a blog. It went nowhere. 
  
  I reached out to people asking if i could help them part-time, and launched a 6-figure consulting business in 25 hours per week. 
  
  I started a travel tech company with two friends. We never got to our first customer. 
  
  Throughout the process, I learned what I loved. What I was passionate about. Everything I did in that time was worthwhile. Every investment paid back 100 times over. 
  
  I learned I'm passionate about helping people take back the ownership in their work, work for themselves, part-time, and enjoy what else their life has to offer (family, travel, passions, companies, friends). 
  
  And now I get to work every day on a company that helps people do that. It's the most fulfilling work I could imagine doing right now. So even when it's hard and we have a tough day or week, I can look back at my  why  and know exactly what I'm doing this all for. And that makes the hard days, long nights, and tough feedback all worth it.
