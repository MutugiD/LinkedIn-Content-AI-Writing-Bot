They focused on a small geographic area, used targeted incentives to get more drivers on the road, leveraged local city teams, and prioritized quality over quantity to achieve a 90% market share in just six months. The takeaway from this story is clear: if you want to be successful as a startup, focus on your core market, involve customer feedback, and execute your strategy effectively.
