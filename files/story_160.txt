I'm so used to saying things like  thanks guys  to my team. But in this day, that feels wrong since they're not all  guys. 
  
  So, what should I say instead? 
  
  Is there some sort of database of all the  best practices  for common sayings that we used to say that are actually not gender neutral?  
  
  I'd benefit from a table showing  what we used to say  and  recommended language today.
