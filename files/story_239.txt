Client:  And how much do you charge for this service? 
  
  Me (nervous):  Umm... $287 / hr 
  
  Client:  Oh wow, our last consultant charged us only $150 / hr 
  
  Me:  Well, they're not me and they don't bring the experience I have to the table. It's not relevant to compare me to another consultant, and if they were the right person to solve this problem, then you wouldn't be talking to me right now. 
  
  Client: Silence 
  
  Me: (sweating nervously hoping my  fake it till you make it  confidence didn't come across as arrogant) 
  
  Client (after 2 days of silence): $287 / hr is too much, but we can agree to $250 / hr with 90% cash and 10% equity. 
  
  Me:  Deal! 
  
  This was my first client back in 2018. I didn't know what was I doing, but I believed my experience was worth a lot to them, and I brought that belief to the negotiation table. 
  
  Whether you've had 10 clients or 0, your experience is incredibly valuable, you've worked your butt off for it, and invested in yourself. 
  
  Don't let a single person convince you otherwise.
