Hard truth: if you're wondering if you  can  consult on the side, it's imposter syndrome. 
  
  Our data shows that there's zero correlation between years of experience and consulting rates. 
  
  This means it comes down to something else entirely: 
  
  1. Confidence 
  2. Honed niche 
  3. Willingness to put yourself out there 
  
  If you have at least 5 years of experience, the above applies to you, and anything else is simply an excuse. 
  
  You have value to bring to a company, and you can bring it as a full-time employee, or as a consultant. 
  
  As a consultant, you: 
  1. Own your time 
  2. Have flexibility in your work life 
  3. Command your own rates 
  4. Scope out projects that you genuinely enjoy 
  
  What are you waiting for?
