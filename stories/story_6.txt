When I worked in Corporate at Uber: 
  
  Total annual comp: $180k 
  Hours of meetings per day: 6 
  Hours per week worked: ~65 
  Average hourly rate: $56 / hour  
  
  When I worked on my own as an expert consultant:

  Hours of meetings per day: 1 
  Hours per week worked: ~30

  It's a new year, but the choice remains the same, and is entirely up to you.
