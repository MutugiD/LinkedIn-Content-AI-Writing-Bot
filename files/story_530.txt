I had a pretty sweet job in my last year at Uber. I led our automation team at Uber Freight. I had 12 really talented analysts under me, I had a seat at the table to make decisions, a decent salary, and reasonable hours.  
  
  But I was miserable.  
  
  For my entire life I’d wanted to be my own boss. I wanted flexibility. I wanted to build for myself. And here I was working for someone else, in an office 9-7, in meetings most of the day, and dealing with corporate politics. 
  
  In the past when I tried to start something myself, I could never get it off the ground. I was never fully “in.” In retrospect, I was scared. Scared to go off “the path,” and scared to fail.  
  
  It was easy to say I wanted to go out on my own.  
  
  To actually do it was terrifying.  
  
  What really got me over the edge was the thought of going my whole life not doing it. That would be far scarier than doing it and failing.  
  
  So I quit. And I put myself out there. 
  
  And incredible things happened. I consulted. I bought (and sold) an ecommerce business. I placed colleagues at companies and got small checks. I started a blog. And I eventually started Mylance. I also got rejected a lot along the way. It’s part of the journey.  
  
  Going out on my own was the best thing I ever did. But at the time, it felt scary, intimidating and completely unknown.
