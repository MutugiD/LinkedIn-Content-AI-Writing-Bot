unpopular opinion: people start consultants companies? joining company full-time one biggest decisions make life. probably make times, joining wrong company (mission, culture, compensation, value, etc.) huge mistake company. contracting company first months, get know other, try out, determine good fit. fit, likely get much better offer, placed ideal spot (for company), longer tenure there. agree? disagree? tell thoughts! #hiring #contract #contracting #thoughts #compensation #tenure #takerisks #challengethestatusquo
