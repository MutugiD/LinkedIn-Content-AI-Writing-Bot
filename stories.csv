  You've worked for it. Now you need to capitalize on it. Here's how I did: 
  
  I was part of the early team at Uber Freight. One of the differences in the product we built was a  book it now  price that required no human touch or negotiation. The pro of this was efficiency and transparency: the price you saw is what you got. 
  
  After I left Uber Freight, I got in touch with a smaller Freight brokerage who had trouble growing in the heavy haul space. After asking a bunch of questions, we agreed to a consulting gig at $17k / month to help them juice their growth. 
  
  After looking at their business, it seemed they were losing money through a cumbersome booking process, and I helped them streamline it with transparency and automation that I had learned from Uber. 
  
  You have amazing knowledge from your experiences. It feels like common sense to you. That common sense is gold to the right person in the right situation. 
  
  Stop leaving money on the table, stop working for free, and monetize that knowledge.

  I got a great question from a customer earlier today. After an intro call with a potential client, she asked me, did I give away too much? Was I too nice? 
  
  No, you're not too nice. But your experience and skillset IS valuable. How do you find the balance between selling them on you, but also holding back valuable info that they should be paying for? 
  
  My recommendation, do a LOT of listening. When they ask you questions, respond with questions. Asking smart questions about their business shows them you know a ton about the topic at hand. 
  
  Further, drop a few tidbits from your experience.  Well when I was at Uber, we thought about it this way.  It validates that you've experienced it before, and your questions validate you know what you're talking about. 
  
  If you ask enough of the right questions, they'll know they need to work with you. Follow-up with a compelling proposal summarizing the company challenges and how your experience lines up to solve them, and you're in great shape!

  Here are 4 ways Ops helped grow Uber to a multi-billion company in a few short years: 
  
  1. Experimentation.  
  
  For new product features, Ops teams had to prove the ROI and use case. We built hacky solutions to A/B test solutions to see what worked. That way, the product teams already knew the solutions would be successful. We'd start an experiment in one city. If it worked, we'd add a few cities, and then a few more. We'd get statistically significant results, and then share with the product teams to review and add to the roadmap. 
  
  2. New city launches 
  
  Uber had designated city launchers that would travel the world, launch a new city, and hand off the business to a GM / city team. These people would navigate the regulations, acquire customers, set up the internal tools structure, implement a quick marketing plan, and make sure the launch went successfully before they moved on.  
  
  3. Ops acted as city CEOs.  
  
  For the first 6-7 years of the company, city teams had full ownership over their cities. They had sole discretion of comms, pricing, incentives, events, and even loyalty programs. Uber eventually needed to unify this under one roof, but in the early days, Uber hired talented, ambitious leaders and gave them full ownership to empower them to grow their cities, and it WORKED. These leaders would share best practices with the other city GMs, enabling cities and regions to grow in tandem.  
  
  4. Ops leaders came from tech, not transportation.  
  
  Uber didn't hire taxi dispatchers to build a global ridesharing operation. Instead, they hired experienced leaders from tech, consulting, engineering, and finance. These people had strong EQs to be customer-facing, but also had the talent to run operations, marketing, and finance. Further, they didn't come from the taxi or black car industries, thus weren't biased in how to grow a transportation network. They could re-think it from scratch and implement innovative solutions to problems. 
  
  There's no right way to build a company. But the experience at Uber taught me a ton about how a tech company can find PMF and then quickly scale to millions of users.","While Uber is no doubt a tech company driven by its product, Ops played a huge role early on in differentiating against the competition.

  Six months later, Uber had 90% market share in the area. 4 things Uber did to come out on top: 
  
  1. Focused on a small geographic area: Instead of trying to cover the entire region, Uber launched in a 7-mile circle in downtown Raleigh, where demand was highest. This allowed them to match rider and driver demand more effectively and keep ETAs under 5 minutes, which was their main KPI at the time. 
  
  2. Used targeted incentives to get more drivers on the road: To achieve their ambitious ETAs, Uber needed more drivers on the road, especially during peak hours. So they used data analysis to identify times when demand was high and offered targeted financial incentives to drivers who were willing to work during those times. 
  
  3. Leveraged local city teams: Unlike Lyft, which was headquartered in San Francisco and oversaw operations nationwide, Uber had dedicated city teams in Raleigh. This allowed them to be more nimble and responsive to local events and trends, and to build stronger relationships with riders and drivers in the area. 
  
  4. Focused on quality over quantity: While Lyft was busy expanding to neighboring cities like Durham and Chapel Hill, Uber stayed focused on improving the rider and driver experience in their core market. They worked closely with drivers to address concerns and feedback, and made sure every support ticket was answered promptly. 
  
  The lesson for other startups is clear: don't try to do everything at once.  
  
  Focus on a core market, listen to your customers, and execute flawlessly.","When Uber and Lyft both launched Raleigh on the same day in 2014, no one could have predicted the outcome.

  The first two things we did had nothing to do with how much money Uber raised: 
  
  1. We talked to users.  
  
  We went to truck stops in Dallas, Texas and spoke to a few hundred truck drivers. We asked them about their pain points, we took detailed notes, and we compiled all our data so we could analyze and find takeaways. 
  
  2. We did things that don’t scale.  
  
  We moved loads manually. While moving freight loads isn’t super novel, it allowed us to get into the weeds of what a tech product would need to look like, and automate from the inside out. Further, it helped us build relationships with our users and get off the ground so that when the tech was ready, we'd have users to adopt it.

2/21/2023,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7033867962075762688,"What launching a city for Uber looked like in 2014: 
  
  To launch a two-sided on-demand marketplace, the biggest challenge was building up supply (in this case, drivers) so demand needs (rider requests) could be met with a good experience.  
  
  For Uber, this meant we needed a concentration of drivers online to accept requests on the road so riders would have a good experience.  
  
  To build up the driver base to launch a new city, Uber would: 
  
  1. Attract driver sign-ups mostly through ads (Craigslist, Indeed) and a referral program 
  
  2. Run every driver through a background check and get their documents reviewed: license, registration, and insurance 
  
  3. Once approved, Uber didn't have the ability to let drivers download the app on their phone. So we needed to give an iPhone to every single driver and teach them how to use the app. To do this we held both in-person  onboarding  events and eventually built a delivery process to ship phones. We'd (usually) take a deposit for the phone with the hopes of getting it back. 
  
  The rider side was a bit easier. We'd work hard to get press, and do a number of  boots on the ground  events to spread the word. 
  
  I personally went to UNC's orientation in Chapel Hill for the Chapel Hill launch. We tried to sign up every new student onto Uber and were frequently met with  I'm not giving my credit card info, I'll just take a cab!  Funny now looking back. 
  
  When the launch was ready to go live, we'd launch in a small geography to ensure 5-min ETAs. It was better to serve a small number of customers really well than widen the geo with a sub-par experience. 
  
  To ensure riders had a good experience, we'd incentivize drivers to stay online through hourly guarantees in a certain geo and accept rider trips. 
  
  After the launch, we were hyper focused on our marketplace metrics to see how well demand was being met, and if drivers were earning enough. The top three marketplace metrics: 
  
  1. Rides Completed / Rides Requested 
  2. % of trips surged 
  3. Driver hourly earnings 
  
  While Uber was far from perfect, we found a way to launch in hundreds of new cities across a few years, following this playbook to scale the local marketplaces quickly!","What launching a city for Uber looked like in 2014:

  So here's a bit about me and my path to running Mylance today: 
  
  I’m Bradley! After 4.5 years at Uber: managing 9 markets in the North Carolinas, launching Uber Eats in Miami and Milan, and 2 years launching and running the Carrier Ops team at Uber Freight, I went out on my own as an independent consultant. 
  
  On my own, I averaged over $25k/ month in 25 hours a week across a dozen clients in 2 years, mostly for Seed and Series A companies helping them launch and scale their marketplaces. 
  
  Throughout this process, I became really passionate about part-time work and how it enables you to follow your passions, spend more time with your family, and own your work schedule.  
  
  It provides the ultimate flexibility.  
  
  I also felt the pain-points of my own business: admin work, finding new leads, bookkeeping, etc. 
  
  So, in early 2020, I founded Mylance to help professionals launch and grow the consulting businesses!  
  
  I think everyone with at least 5 years of experience is capable of part-time work to supplement and replace their W2 income (sometimes 4-6x more!) and I’m really excited to continue working in this space, supporting everyone who wants to be out on their own, monetizing their experience. 
  
  We have some exciting new products we’re working on all aimed at making lead gen in 2023, and the Mylance team is working tirelessly to build products and services to make your lives easier.  
  
  A few personal tid-bits: 
  -Born in NYC but grew up in Fort Lauderdale 
  -Lived in DC and SF for 4.5 years each, now in Austin, TX 
  -Went to Duke studied Mechanical Engineering 
  -Top hobbies: golf, tennis, wine, hiking, fishing, anything on the water, sports 
  -Top teams: New York Giants, Florida Panthers 
  -Don’t have a dog currently but very excited to get one when I’m more settled! 
  
  If I haven't met you yet, would love for you to say hi in the comments!

  Here’s how it happened: 
  
  In early 2017 I moved out to SF to help launch Uber Freight. It was building a “from scratch” start-up within a billion dollar company.  
  
  Here’s what we did: 
  
  1. We did user research like any other company. We went to truck stops in Dallas, TX and spoke to truck drivers. We recorded all the conversations in a Google form. We reviewed answers weekly and found common threads. 
  
  2. We grew without a product. We moved loads manually in the early days using existing, antiquated software. We could see the good and bad about existing solutions, and we were getting users. 
  
  3. Uber acted basically as our “VC fund.” They would give us a small budget to hit a milestone. Once we did, we got more. Each year we’d pitch them asking for a new. While this was way easier than an actual VC round, we spent COUNTLESS hours preparing these decks. It wasn’t as easy as you might think. 
  
  4. While we had access to Uber’s resources, it was hard to take advantage. First, the customer segments do not overlap. At all. Uber Freight matches shippers and carriers. This has nothing to do with riders and drivers. It’s a B2B marketplace with long sales cycles. Secondly, Uber didn’t let us take really anyone from the core business. We couldn’t hire ANYONE. We had to hire externally to avoid disrupting the core business. 
  
  5. We stayed focused. Despite an absolutely enormous market, we focused only on 53’ dry van truckload freight in the US for YEARS. We easily could’ve expanded to flatbed and many other kinds, but we didn’t. There was a multi-billion dollar market in that one focus area alone, so we kept at it. 
  
  6. We hustled - we did whatever it took to onboard new customers. That including cold calling hundreds of new Freight carriers per day, and testing new ways to get them onboarded onto the app. We found that if we had a “good” load for them, they were likely to sign up. So we used the carrot method and called them, trying to get them to use the app for their second load. 
  
  Uber Freight was a startup trying to find product market fit just like any other pre-seed company! 
  
  We moved one load after another. We automated everything we could. We hustled and we pushed through tough challenges. It’s never easy.

  Uber Freight was a startup trying to find product market fit just like any other pre-seed company! 
  
  We moved one load after another. We automated everything we could. We hustled and we pushed through tough challenges. It’s never easy. It’s just different levels of hard."
1/4/2023,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7016434760004608000,"Uber Eats in Miami launched on July 12th, 2016.  
  
  On the first day, we did 1,003 orders making it one of the most successful launches at that time.  
  
  Here's what happened on the inside to make our launch day a success:  
  
  1. A successful launch is all about what happens in the weeks and days leading up to it. The launch day is almost  after the fact.  So, we did 6 weeks of hectic but carefully planned prep to give ourselves the best chance at success. 
  
  2. We launched in a small geography. With a live logistics marketplace, trying to cover a large area is really difficult. We preferred to create a great experience to a smaller number of customers rather than a mediocre one to a larger audience. 
  
  3. We utilized our resources, namely existing riders already on the Uber app. Uber Miami was already a big business. We didn't need to reinvent a brand new marketing strategy. We tried to convert as many existing riders to new eaters as possible, and didn't use promotions to do it. We did give away free delivery for the first few weeks. 
  
  4. For couriers, we didn't want to disrupt the rides business, so we used drivers who didn't previously qualify for Uber (based on the age or size of their car), in addition to onboarding new ones by advertising on Craigslist, Indeed, and posting flyers at autoshops and bike stores. 
  
  5. We did a lot of testing. We did an internal launch 2 weeks before the actual launch day to the internal office. We tested all the restaurants, gave feedback to the couriers, and made sure the systems worked. Then we did a soft launch to a small list of highly engaged Uber Riders a few days before to make sure everything worked externally. We collected as much feedback as we could. 
  
  6. Pounded the pavement to onboard as many quality restaurants as possible. We knew customers wanted diversity. To have a successful launch, customers needed to go into the app and see a restaurant they liked. Our benchmark was 100 quality restaurants (based on Yelp reviews) in 4 weeks. That takes a lot of calls, meetings, selling, and closing. 
  
  Given Uber was well funded, we certainly had plenty of resources behind us to make this launch a success. That being said, it still took a ton of planning, strategy, and pure hustle to put it all together. 
  
  When I think about launching a new product in my business today, I remember these lessons from Uber and spend all my time in the planning phase to give myself the best chance for success.","Uber Eats in Miami launched on July 12th, 2016.

  Fast forward 6 months, Uber had 90% market share in the area.  
  
  Here's how we won: 
  
  1. Uber's main KPI at the time was ETAs.  
  
  When a rider was ready to take a trip, we wanted them to get a driver in under 5 minutes. So we launched in a very small geographic area, and our team worked our butts off to match rider and driver demand so ETAs were under 5 minutes. 
  
  Thus, we launched Uber in Raleigh in a 7 mile circle in downtown Raleigh in April 2014. 
  
  Lyft, on the other hand, launched in Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill on that same day. They thought covering the entire area (each of those areas are 30-45 min from each other) would help them win since they were first. 
  
  However, their result was 10-20 minute ETAs for the entire area. So while Uber wasn't available in Durham & Chapel Hill, Lyft's experience was already sub-par. 
  
  2. For our team to hit 5 minute ETAs in our small geo, we needed more drivers on the road AND we needed existing drivers to drive when the demand was.  
  
  So we did tons of top of funnel marketing: ads, driver referrals, and flyers were the best performing methods. And for existing drivers, we looked closely at the real-time data and we'd design targeted incentives.  
  
  When we saw rider demand not being met, we'd target X number of drivers with extra financial incentives to drive during those times so all ETAs were under 5 minutes. Yes, we burned money to meet rider demand. And it worked. 
  
  3. As we grew our small geo in Raleigh and more and more rides were under a 5 minute ETA, we started to build a driver base in Durham and Chapel Hill. We did driver onboarding events, we advertised that we were  coming soon  and we built up supply so come launch day, we'd cover the area well. And 3 months after we launched Raleigh (and 3 months behind Lyft), we launched Durham and Chapel Hill nearly hitting sub-5 minute ETAs on day 1. 
  
  4. Uber had local city teams at this time. Meaning my team's sole focus was on the Raleigh-Durham area. We lived, ate, and breathed Uber Raleigh. I worked day and night to grow my market and ensure happy riders and drivers. I answered every single driver support ticket myself.  
  
  Lyft, on the other hand, had their company in SF overseeing the United States. They didn't have dedicated city teams. This meant when there were events going on in Raleigh, we knew about it and we'd make sure Uber drivers would be there. I don't know what Lyft did, but their presence lacked, and we'd win the big events. 
  
  And fast forward 6 months from launch, and Uber had a >90% market share in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area. 
  
  Uber and Lyft's product wasn't different. Pricing wasn't different. But the go to market strategy, execution, and focus were night and day.  
  
  And it taught me a valuable lesson: you don't have to be first. You just have to be focused on what matters most.","Uber and Lyft both launched UberX in Raleigh on the same day.

  When I launched Miami, we had 6 weeks to do it.  
  
  Here's everything we did to make it happen: 
  
  1. We needed sales reps pounding the pavement. So we hired 5 of them. How we found them quickly? We advertised the role, threw a  happy hour  where we talked to about 40 candidates. We narrowed it down to 10, interviewed them individually, and hired 5 hungry, personable sales folks. 
  
  2. As the head launcher on a very tight timeline, I had to know what  good  looked like. Meaning what needed to happen every single day to be on target for the launch. So I modeled it out, and shared it with the team. We'd track against the projection every day. 
  
  3. We designed a restaurant sales playbook so we'd all start with the same pitch. Asking restaurants to give Uber at 30% cut of the gross revenue was a BIG ask. So we needed a really strong pitch. 
  
  4. We set quotas and performance bonuses for the rep who signed the most restaurants in a week. Nothing like rewarding performance and hustle. 
  
  5. Every single day we'd get the sales team together and talk about what worked, and what didn't. Things started super slow and we were well behind those targets I'd set. We needed to pick up momentum, so sharing best practices from the top performing reps was KEY. One insight was the best time to catch a decision maker (10am - 11am before lunch and 4-5pm before the dinner rush were ideal times.) 
  
  6. With harder to close but important restaurants, we'd have a manager step in to close the deal. If a sales rep had the deal close but couldn't get it over the finish line, we'd bring a manager in to support and close. We were a team and we wanted our reps to know they had support. 
  
  7. We started a number of restaurants on a lower  starter  commission rate. It was a great way to get a restaurant signed up for 25% for 3 months, with the plan to increase after that first 90 days.  
  
  8. We hustled. We ground it out. There was no silver bullet. It was a numbers game and a hustle game. We made it a friendly competition amongst the reps, we rallied together as a team, and we got the job done. 
  
  And all in all, we get 100+ restaurants by the launch day, and made it on time. I will never forget those days. We hustled hard, but we were all in it together as a team.

The company had reached out to dozens of ex-Uber folks asking for help with their food delivery marketplace, and when they reached out to me for a full-time role, I told them I wasn't open to full-time, but that I could help them part-time and still get the job done.  
  
  It was the truth - I wasn't ready to jump into another full-time role after Uber. And I wanted to help another company given my Uber Operations and launch experience.  
  
  I ended up working with that client for almost 9 months, working 25 hours per week, and kicking off my independent consulting life where I earned more than my Uber salary in half the number of hours across nearly two years. 
  
  That life is real. I'm not a designer. I'm not an engineer. I'm an operator.

The company had reached out to dozens of ex-Uber folks asking for help with their food delivery marketplace, and when they reached out to me for a full-time role, I told them I wasn't open to full-time, but that I could help them part-time and still get the job done.  
  
  It was the truth - I wasn't ready to jump into another full-time role after Uber. And I wanted to help another company given my Uber Operations and launch experience.  
  
  I ended up working with that client for almost 9 months, working 25 hours per week, and kicking off my independent consulting life where I earned more than my Uber salary in half the number of hours across nearly two years. 
  
  That life is real. I'm not a designer. I'm not an engineer. I'm an operator.

  I don't know where it came from. But time and time again I've asked for what I want and it's gotten me so much more than I could've imagined. 
  
  After I graduated college I interned at a start-up. They wanted to give me cash and instead I asked for a half equity and half cash split. They gave it to me, and fast forward 12 years and the company is doing great and on track to get sold. 
  
  At Uber I asked if I could launch Uber Eats in Europe. 1 month later I was on a plane to Amsterdam and ended up owning the Milan, Italy launch. 
  
  I wanted to help start-ups part-time instead of full-time. I asked 12 companies. 1 said yes, and became my first client at $250/hr at 25 hours per week. I worked with them for 9 months and kicked off an amazing few years consulting.  
  
  In the middle of a networking call with a former colleague who wanted to launch her own consulting business, I asked if she wanted help in exchange for a rev-share. She accepted, which eventually kicked off an Accelerator program helping tech professionals launch 6-figure consulting businesses. 
  
  I don't know where I'd be in my career if I wasn't willing to take the risk, ask for what I want, and be willing to hear a  no.  Often, I'll get a  yes  and each  yes  has changed my life in ways I never could've imagined.

  Once I quit Uber and took a little bit of time off, I was ready to start working on what was next. I wanted to start a company. But I didn’t know what I wanted to start.  
  
  I also wondered how I was going to support myself. I couldn’t just keep going without income. I considered if I could help out companies part-time. So, I did some outreach. Or rather, I responded to some LinkedIn inbound recruiters and hiring managers. 
  
  I responded to each of them honestly that I was willing to help them part-time.  
  
  Here’s a sample note I sent: 
  
  Thanks for reaching out. I definitely think my 4 years at Uber could be helpful as AutoX rolls out their self-driving marketplace. Do you see an opportunity for me to help as more of an advisor than a full-time role? I'm currently not in the market for a full-time role, but am open to other arrangements.

  I sent out 12 notes like this. 11 times I got a “no” or just no response. 
  
  One of the 12, however, responded positively back that they were down to get on a call and chat. 
  
  I had my first lead. I didn’t call them leads at that time. I didn’t know anything.  
  
  I jumped on a call with them and talked about my experience at Uber, and inquired about their needs.  
  
  They asked me to send over a proposal of what a working arrangement could look like. I didn’t have a template or any kind of idea what this could look like. So I did what any business minded person does best. I made a deck that included: 
  
  1. My background 
  2. The terms of the agreement including my rate 
  3. The challenges I understood facing the company 
  4. The questions I expected to address 
  5. A sample food delivery marketplace business model 
  
  I sent it over. 
  
  I guess they liked it, because they invited me onsite for an interview (this was long before COVID was an issue). I spoke to a few different members of their team including the CEO and COO. 
  
  I got a call a few days later from the recruiter that they’d like to offer me the contract, but that my rate was a bit too high. 
  
  I had made up some random number calculating my Uber salary, projected equity, added in a huge buffer for health insurance and other contractor costs, and divided by 40 hours per week and 49 weeks per year.  
  
  It came out to $267 per hour. This felt high, but what did I have to lose?  
  
  So when the phone call came in and told me my rate was too high, I got nervous. I couldn’t really defend that rate. But I did something that in hindsight was smart: I asked them to counter. They countered at $250 / hr (only 7% lower than what I’d asked for). I accepted on the spot. Deal.  
  
  While the contract was hourly, if I worked 20 hours per week I’d make $20k per month, and at 25 hours per week, I’d make $25k per month.

12/27/2022,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7013572014892269568,"The Freight market in the US is an $800 billion industry, with the Freight Brokerage market being ~10% of that at $80+ billion.  
  
  Here's how Uber Freight started from scratch, broke in, and became worth $1B within 2 years of being founded. 
  
  First, Uber acquired Otto. The acquisition was originally for self-driving tech, but the small team at Otto was also in the process of building a freight marketplace, so Uber inherited that in the acquisition, and with the acquisition, the team kept building the freight marketplace.  
  
  Things that don't scale 
  At this time (early 2017), all loads were moved manually. We were using antiquated freight software, calling truck drivers manually, and moving loads the traditional way: with emails, texts, calls, and old software. We probably moved 5-10 loads per day. 
  
  User Research 
  At the same time, we were building tech. But we didn't know exactly what to build. We needed to do user research and figure out the problems to be solved and jobs to be done. 
  
  So a small group of us would jump on a flight, go to Dallas, TX, and go to truck stops. There we'd interview as many truck drivers as we could, learn their problems, document everything, and compile the results. 
  
  Shipper Sales 
  At the same time, shipper sales reps reached out to medium and enterprise shippers getting loads. They would sell shippers on the future vision of Uber Freight: a digital marketplace where you could track your loads in real-time. By selling the vision, they had a lot of early success, and of course, having the  Uber  name helped a lot in these conversations. 
  
  Product Development 
  Based on our research, we decided to build a driver-facing app that allowed them to book a load directly. While not novel tech, this was quite novel for the freight industry as drivers were used to haggling over the phone.  
  
  As a team, we wanted to grow and move more and more loads. So once the tech was built, we'd try to get as many drivers to use the app as possible. We'd call them, onboard them onto the app, and teach them how to use it. 
  
  We hired a team of call agents who would spend all day every day calling drivers. We found that onboarding them onto the app was useless unless we had a load for them. So we'd actually look at the loads first, then call drivers in that area and onboard them onto the app to accept that load. The more well-paying loads we had, the better our driver app adoption was. 
  
  And that's what we focused on for 2 straight years. When we couldn't get a load taken on the app, we had a team moving freight manually, as our commitment to the shipper was getting the load moved. 
  
  It was a constant balance between growth, automation, and margin, and the entire team would hustle incredibly hard to become a relevant line item before the Uber IPO.  
  
  And by the time Uber would go public, the business unit would be a material line item and is now valued at over $4B, only 5 years after being founded.","The Freight market in the US is an $800 billion industry, with the Freight Brokerage market being ~10% of that at $80+ billion.

  I would say  I specialize in launching and scaling two and three sided B2B and B2C marketplaces given my experience launching UberEATS in Miami and Milan and Uber Freight in the US.

  And this wasn’t new: the company often lost nearly $1B per quarter as we heavily invested in the global expansion of Rides and Eats and then additional but significant bets on Autonomous Vehicles, Freight, and VTOL (flying cars). 
  
  My experience in 2014 reflected this.  
  
  As crazy as it was, when I first started we didn’t have a P&L for each city (we soon did get one!) but the truth is, we were focused on growth, and the company was willing to invest heavily in rider and driver incentives to scale quickly and fend off the competition. 
  
  When I launched Uber Eats in Miami, I had to come up with a 12-month P&L for the city.  
  
  By the end of the 12 months, the model showed us squeaking out a profit (barely). When the Head of Uber Eats questioned me on it, I didn’t have much of a response: the unit economics of that business were brutal, and only a perfectly run marketplace would make any money. 
  
  Fast forward to today, excluding a UK settlement, free cash flow for Uber was $430 million for Q4 2022. 
  
  Further, the Delivery business line brought in an adjusted EBITDA of $241 million in Q4 2022.  
  
  While I’m not on the inside anymore, I can’t understate this incredible achievement for the entire Uber team. 
  
  While it certainly wasn’t perfectly executed (far from it!!), the people that built Uber from day 1 until today have a ton to be proud of in bringing a life-changing company to cities around the world, taking on billions of VC money, going through an up and down rollercoaster of wins and failures, to a profitable, growing, sustainable company.

  Since then, I've helped hundreds of fractional execs improve their value prop. Here's our 3 step process: 
  
  We're covering the full process in the Mylance Community for the #Maymonthlychallenge but here is the TL;DR 
  
  
  -Step 1: Narrow in on what you've done in your career that's great. 
  
  Look back at your career to date and write down your professional accomplishments where you’re most proud (ideally, when you made the biggest impact to your company). 
  
  Don’t forget to think about what work you enjoyed the most. We include “enjoyed the most” so that you’re pitching yourself in a way that will lead to you working on projects that you actually want to work on. That’s one of the biggest benefits of consulting: you choose the projects YOU want to work on! 
  
  
  -Step 2: Identify your tangible, concrete skills and superpowers 
  
  Now that you have your accomplishments outlined, think through what it is about you that helped you accomplish these great things. These are the things that make you unique and different. 
  
  Write down one sentence for each accomplishment. To make this easy, you can write down them in the format of: 
  
  I'm an expert at {action you did} for {this type of company} to accomplish {what results you drove}.  
  
  
  -Step 3: Combine the two to nail your niche 
  
  Your pitch essentially aligns your area of expertise (step 2) and is backed up by your accomplishments (step 1).  
  
  So, it can look like this: 
  
  I’m an expert at launching marketplaces, including B2C, B2B, and two and three-sided marketplaces that enables me to help companies scale their operations.

  The problem? I never kept going. Until now. Here's how it would go: 
  
  I would get excited about an idea. Probably buy a domain. I'd work for a few weeks or a few months on it, and then I'd stop. I would hit a roadblock, or get bored, or get discouraged, and I'd stop.

I decided that nothing was going to stop me from building it - I was all in and frankly, I think that's what it takes.

  We're good at talking: saying we're going to do it and maybe even planning out HOW we'll do it. 
  
  But when it comes down to it, we struggle and often give up.  
  
  This is because we focus on outcomes, instead of the process.  
  
  We see a goal. We want to achieve that goal. But we don't put in place routines, process, or accountability to actually make it happen.

  They no doubt want to. Many even see the path to doing so. But they never get off the ground.

  But what separates one Fractional COO/CMO/CFO from another? 
  
  Let's look at some examples to differentiate and win clients: 
  
  1. Industry experience: you can be a Fractional COO differentiated in an industry, specifically one that largely benefits from industry experience. E.g., Healthcare has lots of regulation and nuance, so having this experience will matter a lot to your clients. 
  
  2. In conjunction with another function. Let's say you're a Fractional COO but also have finance experience. This adds value to your clients because you can do more than just Operations, and bringing on fewer people with varied experience is a value-add. 
  
  3. Adding skills to your title. Comparing a  Fractional COO  with a  Data-Driven Fractional COO with SQL, Python, and R expertise  is night and day. While the company may not have these as an immediate need, it's certainly nice to have for the future and makes you an obvious choice over someone without these skills. 
  
  4. Company-building experience. Let's say you're a Fractional COO who was also a founder with fundraising experience. Adding this experience to your pitch is a huge differentiator to the right client. Call out a specific, value-add experience you've had that bolsters your pitch. Examples could be fundraising, sales, marketing, design, or analytics (and there are thousands more). 
  
  5. Tenure. Do clients want to hire brand new Fractional COOs or experienced ones? It seems obvious, but it's left out of many niches. If you have 10 years of experience, call that out. A  Fractional COO with a decade of experience  sounds a lot more compelling than just a  Fractional COO. 
  
  Put this into practice: 
  
  1. Fractional COO specializing in Cannabis 
  
  2. Fractional COO with an Accounting background 
  
  3. Data-Driven Fractional COO with SQL, R, and Python Experience 
  
  4. Fractional COO with additional experience in marketing funnels and email copywriting 
  
  5. Fractional COO with a decade of experience 
  
  Make it even more powerful with a combination of these: 
  
  I'm a data-driven, Fractional COO with a decade of experience navigating the Cannabis Industry, with additional expertise in SQL, R, and Python. 
  
  You're no longer a Fractional COO. Now you're differentiated, and the Cannabis founder that needs Operational support is going to say  this person is for ME.

  Here's why (and how you can overcome it). 
  
  Doing the thing we NEED to do is often scary. It comes with the potential of rejection. It forces us to face a fear. 
  
  So, we subconsciously put it off. 
  
  We don't send that outreach email. We don't send that proposal. We avoid getting that feedback.  
  
  Instead, we respond to emails in our inboxes and text messages from our friends. We read the news and scroll through social media. 
  
  We subconsciously know that none of that stuff moves the needle. But we do it because it's comfortable. It's easy. 
  
  For me, I love building models. I love modeling how Mylance can grow. At this point, I've built at least 50+ models for projecting Mylance's growth. Guess how much that moves the needle? Nearly zero. It's just in my comfort zone. 
  
  Here's what I'm doing to overcome this (feel free to steal it from me!) 
  
  1. I have very clear objectives for what I want Mylance to achieve in the next month, quarter, and year. 
  
  2. I write my monthly goal at the top of my to-do list.  
  
  3. Before the week starts, I write my  big rocks  for the week, along with 2  must-do  items for Monday.  
  
  I check if these items specifically contribute (i.e., do they move the needle) to my monthly goal that's right above the to-do list. If they don't, I remove them. 
  
  4. When the work day starts, I tackle my  must-do  items before anything else happens. I don't open email or Slack. I don't respond to anyone. I knock out those needle moving items. It's the ONLY thing that matters in that moment. 
  
  This way, I can't procrastinate. I can't distract myself. I can't rationalize that I'll  do it tomorrow.   
  
  You know the things you need to be doing.  
  
  But sometimes, they're scary.  
  
  And that's okay.

  Rejection is an inevitable part of any consulting career, and it can be a jarring experience, regardless if you're just starting out, or if you're a seasoned professional.  
  
  In these moments, the Imposter Villain may try to make a comeback, exploiting your vulnerabilities and casting doubt on your abilities. 
  
  In this post, we tackle how to face rejection head-on, silence the Imposter Villain once more, and emerge stronger than before. 
  
  1. Embrace the Learning Opportunity: Instead of letting rejection derail your progress, view it as a chance to grow.  
  
  Analyze the situation, identify areas for improvement, and use this newfound knowledge to refine your approach. By treating rejection as a valuable learning experience, you'll disarm the Imposter Villain and fortify your resilience. 
  
  2. Seek Support: Lean on your trusted network of peers, mentors, and friends for encouragement and advice. They'll help you put rejection into perspective, remind you of your strengths, and provide guidance on how to bounce back.  
  
  With a strong support system, the Imposter Villain's whispers will struggle to gain traction. 
  
  3. Don't Take It Personally: Remind yourself that rejection is a natural part of the consulting landscape and is often influenced by factors beyond your control.  
  
  By detaching your self-worth from the outcome, you'll weaken the Imposter Villain's grip and maintain your confidence. 
  
  4. Keep Moving Forward: When faced with rejection, it's crucial to continue forging ahead. Pursue new opportunities, refine your strategies, and maintain your momentum.  
  
  Each step forward is a victory against the Imposter Villain and a testament to your unwavering determination. 
  
  Rejection may be a tough pill to swallow, but it also presents an opportunity to grow, learn, and fortify your resilience.

  As a consultant, determining your rates can be a challenging task, especially when the Great Imposter is lurking in the shadows, sowing seeds of doubt.  
  
  In this post, we delve into the importance of setting rates that accurately reflect your TRUE value – encompassing your experience, education, coaching, feedback, and learnings.  
  
  By having the courage to ask for your full worth, you'll not only build a sustainable consulting business but also bolster your self-confidence. 
  
  1. Assess Your Value: Begin by taking inventory of the unique assets you bring to the table, such as your expertise, years of experience, educational background, and problem-solving abilities.  
  
  Recognize that your value extends beyond just delivering a service – your insights, feedback, and ongoing support all contribute to the overall value you provide to clients. 
  
  2. Avoid Underpricing: Resist the urge to undervalue your services or work for free just to gain experience. While it may be tempting, this approach can undermine your credibility and perpetuate the 's hold on your self-worth.  
  
  Remember, your experience and knowledge are valuable – and you deserve to be compensated accordingly. 
  
  3. Communicate Your Value: When discussing rates with potential clients, confidently articulate the benefits they'll receive from working with you.  
  
  Emphasize the long-term value of your expertise and how your consulting services can help them achieve their goals.  
  
  By communicating your value effectively, you'll be more likely to secure your desired rates. 
  
  4. Make the ask. It can be scary to ask for money. That's the Great Imposter doing its work. Say  hi  to him/her, and then ask for that rate you've been wanting to ask for anyways. The worst a client can say is  no,  and then you can ask them to counter.  
  
  By setting rates that truly capture your worth, you'll send a powerful message – both to your clients and yourself – that you're a confident and capable consultant.

  Here's what happened to me: 
  
  Even though I was having financial success, going out on my own caused a huge amount of emotional confusion.  
  
  In corporate, I was used to a very set structure: 
  
  I'd go into the office at mostly the same time in the morning. I had a to-do list, meetings to attend, and a boss to report to. 
  
  I had a salary and title. I'd get predictable % raises from the salary, a pretty clear idea for the promotion timeline, and what bonus I could expect at each level. 
  
  I had performance reviews and a weekly 1:1 (some of the time) where I'd get structured feedback and evaluations based on my performance.  
  
  **But when I went out on my own, that all disappeared.** 
  
  I didn't have to be anywhere at a given time. I had maybe 2 meetings a week. I could sleep in, work from the beach, or not work at all any given day.  
  
  I had no structure. I'd pitch my own compensation that varied from project to project. I had no title. I got nearly no feedback (unless I forced a Google form on them). 
  
  This might sound great. And honestly, it was. But it was also incredibly confusing. I often had existential questions:  
  
  Am I doing well? 
  
  Is this ok? 
  
  Should someone at 30 be doing this? 
  
  Why do we even work? 
  
  I needed to add my own structure to the confusion. And all of a sudden, I had: 
  
  1. A morning routine 
  2. Set times to work along with meetings with myself on different topics 
  3. Feedback requested from clients so I could learn and improve 
  4. Goals for myself so I knew what  good  looked like 
  
  And now I had a structure of my own that eerily resembled the structure I had in corporate.

  Here’s how to monetize yourself to $10k / month: 
  
  1. Differentiate yourself from the herd. 
  
  Being a “product manager” or “ops specialist” doesn’t help you. Describe yourself in a clear, concise way to stand out, and make sure you can describe your value-add. “I scale supply for food delivery marketplaces” as an example. 
  
  2. Put yourself out there. 
  
  Once you can explain your value-add, you need to get on calls with potential clients. Talk to your network. Do outreach to companies that fit your niche. Reach out to 3-4 people per day all week and set-up calls. 
  
  3. On the calls, ask questions. 
  
  Do not pitch yourself. Be curious by asking thoughtful questions. 
  
  Understand their challenges and pain points. Ask questions in your area of expertise. This will help you learn if there’s an opportunity while validating your experience at the same time. 
  
  4. When there’s an opportunity, respond with a detailed proposal in 24 hours. 
  
  Your proposal needs to hit on 4 things: 
  a. Remind them who you are and why you’re a badass 
  b. Review the company goals

  It's not complicated, and anyone can do it.  
  
  It's asking thoughtful, curious questions. 
  
  Asking great questions does a few things: 
  
  1. If you can ask thoughtful questions in an area of your expertise, you showcase your experience indirectly. Ask how they are thinking about XYZ (your area of expertise). Keep asking until you get to a point where they don’t have a great answer. They might turn it around on you and ask for your help! Boom, you have a client. 
  
  2. It shows you’ve done your homework, and they like that you’re interested in them. 
  
  3. It gets them talking. People like talking, and especially about themselves and their business. 
  
  4. You’ll learn a lot about their business and specifically areas they need help (hint: this is key!).  
  
  Examples of good questions: 
  
  1. What in your business is keeping you up at night? 
  2. What is your two biggest business goals right now?  
  3. What's holding you back from accomplishing those goals?

  1. My headline shares how I add value. From two seconds looking at my profile, I try to stand out. For you as a consultant, you’re an expert in a field. You’re not a job title. Your header is the first thing a profile visitor reads. So, it’s crucial that it stands out. 
  
  2. My bio legitimizes me. My bio provides additional context on my niche through my professional accomplishments, and legitimizes me to my audience. I also use it to humanize me by sharing some interests outside of work. People want to work with interesting humans. Share some of your hobbies. 
  
  3. I have contact links easily accessible so people can get in touch with me or sign-up. Let's face it: your LinkedIn doesn’t do a great job of sharing your portfolio, case studies, testimonials, or your brand. Thus, you want a separate website or landing page to direct them to, and they’re also likely to contact you there.

  And many customers I talk to admit the same.  
  
  Here’s what I do to deal with it and overcome it: 
  
  1. I list out my accomplishments. It might sound silly, but it has a huge impact on how I look and feel about myself professionally. I think about the products I’ve grown, the people I’ve impacted, the managers who went to bat for me. I write it down and I look at it monthly. 
  
  2. I meditate on and then list out my biggest goals. I have to know where I want to go for me to get there. So I think hard about them and I write them down: 1 year goals, 5 year goals, 10 year goals. They can change, but it’s important for me to have them down. 
  
  3. I write down worst case scenarios. I have plenty of fear of failure. Who doesn’t? Writing down the worst case scenario helps me proceed anyway because it’s often not as bad as I think. E.g., if I quit my job, go out on my own, and completely strike out for 3 months, will I be OK? Could I get another job? Usually, the answer is yes and the bigger worst case scenario is never trying on my own. 
  
  4. Journaling. I journal a lot. Nearly every day now. I journal the thoughts in my head. I get them down on paper which gets them out of my head. It helps me to stop worrying in my down time, add them to my to-do list, and work on them during productive working hours. 
  
  5. I surround myself with motivated, high-value people all pursuing their dreams. The reality is if you put yourself out there and try new things, you’re going to fail a lot. That’s part of being successful, and the more I can normalize it and surround myself with people that try, make mistakes, and try again, the more normal it becomes to me and I embrace the “failures” (which really aren’t failures at all). 
  
  In reality, the only “failure” would be not trying at all. And that is certainly not how I’m going to define my life.  
  
  I’m going to give it my all. Try new things. Make mistakes and try again. And along that way, I’ll keep finding success, one step at a time.

  Here’s how I structure my life to own my time and get some back: 
  
  1. I block off my entire mornings for myself. I know I’m my most efficient self before 1pm. So I block off that time for deep work, and take nearly all my meetings in the afternoon. 
  
  2. If I didn’t sleep well or am feeling overwhelmed, I can take the morning off. I go to the gym, go for a walk, go to my favorite coffee shop, play tennis, or just sleep in. Sometimes I need to recharge, even on a weekday, and by blocking off my morning from meetings, I can do this. 
  
  3. I use Turkey Blocker to work for 30-45 min blocks with no distractions. It blocks certain apps and websites so I can stay heads down. I’m so quick to check Twitter, LinkedIn, or email. This forces my discipline. 
  
  4. I write a to-do list the night before. I write 3-4 crucial things that need to happen to make the day a success. Those are the first things I tackle in the morning. If nothing else happens in the day, it’s already a success. 
  
  5. Every Sunday night I write the “big rocks” for the week. These roll up to our monthly OKRs, and keep me clear and focused going into the week. 
  
  6. I have a VA that helps me with my calendar, email, and small tasks. She’s online during my entire business day so when I need something, she’s there. She costs about $1k / month, and easily saves me 20-30 hours per week. 
  
  7. I’ve started saying “no” a lot more. I wish I could help everyone. But, I can’t. I take 2-3 networking calls a week now. For anything over that limit, I offer to help via a Loom video or voice note. It’s not perfect, but I know I need to prioritize my own business before I help others. 
  
  What do you do to structure your life and stay focused?",Nope
1/23/2023,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7023334454911729664,"If you pitch yourself as an “Operations expert,” nobody has any idea what you do.  
  
  Here’s what to do instead: 
  
  Your goal is to have your expertise be in the top 1% so you can differentiate yourself and command high rates.  
  
  You also want a client to easily understand your value-add in 1-2 sentences. 
  
  If you market yourself as an “Operations Expert” you won't stand out and a client can't differentiate your skillset. 
  
  You might have varied experience and consider yourself a generalist. And maybe you are. But we can’t pitch you like that.  
  
  We need to narrow in on our niche and differentiate ourselves. 
  
  To do this, consider what you’ve actually done in your career. The highlights. Your proudest accomplishments.  
  
  Let's use a growth marketing example. 
  
  You didn’t accomplish “growth marketing.” You nailed down the marketing channels and defined a strategy for each one to enable your start-up to scale. 
  
  Use simple terms. Make it easy to understand. 
  
  Once you have that, brainstorm whom you do that for. Do you do it for environmental non-profits? Seed stage fin-tech start-ups? Publicly traded marketplaces? Get specific. 
  
  Now, combine those two.  
  
  “I find the best marketing channels for your Seed stage, Fintech start-up, and execute the strategy for each one.”

1/23/2023,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7023332571174330369,"Negotiating used to make me nervous.  
  
  Now, I love it. Here’s how I reframed it for myself: 
  
  The first time I negotiated for myself, I got a $250 / hr, $25k / month consulting client. But I was terrified.  
  
  I didn’t want to lose the deal, but I also wanted to get what I thought I deserved. It felt like a really difficult position. 
  
  But now, I look forward to it. 
  
  I think of negotiating as a fact-finding mission: I’m trying to learn as much as possible about the other side. I learn by asking curious questions. 
  
  I also make sure they feel heard. I repeat what I hear back to them.  
  
  Sometimes I don’t have it quite right, and they correct me. 
  
  I also label what I hear from them. “It seems like you’re tight on budget.” 
  
  Again, they will correct me. If I’m right, they will validate it, and they’ll feel heard. 
  
  By learning everything about their side, I can suggest solutions that work for both of us.  
  
  Usually, there’s overlap in what we both want, and by asking questions, I can more easily find that overlap. 
  
  Lastly, I'll go into the conversation prepared. I know my floor. I know what “good” would look like for me. I anchor high, ask questions, and never negotiate against myself. 
  
  I also know I need to be okay to walk away. I know it’s better to not make any deal than agree to one I’ll regret. 
  
  Big shout out to Christopher Voss with his book “Never Split the Difference” which helped me change my entire perspective on negotiating, and changed my life more than any other book I’ve read!

  I used an underrated tactic to stay positive: 
  
  I’d never gotten rejected more in my life than when I went to go raise money. Everyone in my network told me it would be easy.  
  
  Well, it wasn’t. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. 
  
  But I had to stay positive. I had to keep grinding.  
  
  And more importantly, I had to go into the next conversation confident and excited, believing they’d say “yes.”  
  
  After 100 “no’s” it’s very hard to be confident going into your 101st investor pitch. 
  
  But it wasn’t the first thing that was tough as I built my company. It was tough from the beginning.  
  
  Customers saying “no.” Tough feedback on our initial products. Lack of motivation. Criticism all over the place. 
  
  So, I started a list of accomplishments. And I put EVERYTHING on the list. 
  
  “I bought a domain.” 
  “I chose a name.” 
  “I made my first dollar.” 
  “First $100 of revenue.” 
  “Hired a lawer.” 
  
  The list might have been 100 items long 6 months into the company’s lifespan.

  It was a reminder of how far I’d come from the beginning. From when Mylance was just an exciting idea. 
  
  And it’s how I got through those investor rejections. 
  
  I ended up getting 15 yes’s and 154 “no’s.” The 15 yes’s filled out our Angel round, and funded our next stage of development.

  With that said, here are 10 tips after building up my own business and helping thousands of others do it: 
  
  1. Network. Take calls. Be open to new conversations. Help others. It will come back to you.  
  
  2. When there's an opportunity, write a kick-ass proposal. Make the leads at the client feel heard in their challenges and very clearly show how you'll add value. 
  
  3. Make it easy to hire you. Find a way to get started. Once you get in the door, knock it out of the park and expand your scope. 
  
  4. Charge for your value, not your time. Never work for free. 
  
  5. Raise your rates. Ask for what you truly want. The worst they can say is  no. 
  
  6. Confront any fears and imposter thoughts head on. We all have it. Overcome it so you can thrive. 
  
  7. Get smart with your LLC. Explore an S-Corp election. Deduct everything you can. You'll save tons of money. 
  
  8. Aim high. You can make 3-4x your W2 consulting. That requires you to say  no  often, and carefully pick how you spend your time. 
  
  9. Have a clearly defined narrow niche, but be ready to adapt to what the client needs.  
  
  10. Design your life how you want. Set your own structure. It doesn't matter what anyone else does, including your past self. You're in charge. Take advantage.

  I had wanted to start a company that added value to people ever since I can remember. 
  
  And I had started many companies. I'd just never followed through. 
  
  I would get super excited about an idea. Do some research and maybe write up a business plan. I'd buy a domain and get a website live. And then it would get hard. And I'd inevitably stop. It was a repeating cycle that I couldn't shake. 
  
  When I incorporated Mylance, I decided those days were over. That no matter what happened, I was going to see Mylance through to be a success. I didn't know what it would look like. I didn't know how I'd get there. I just knew that every single day I would take one step forward, talk to one more customer, do one more to-do list item, and move the needle.

  I signed a new client today. Here's how I did it: 
  
  I got the intro from a mutual connection in my network, and we scheduled an intro call. 
  
  I did some digging ahead of the call to understand what the company does, their current challenges, and what they're trying to achieve 
  
  Once on the call, this is where the  magic  happens. 
  
  1. I control the call. I ask to start with intros and ask them to go first. When it's my turn, I have a <60 second intro that gives my relevant background and accomplishments, and how I've helped similar companies. 
  
  2. I then ask them curious but pointed questions in my area of expertise. When I get answers I don't totally follow or I'm unclear about, I point it out and ask again.  
  
  I'm blunt about where I think they need to focus and improve.  
  
  I challenge them on their assumptions and approach (respectfully, of course). 
  
  I then share how I approached a similar problem they're facing in my past. (This validates me more as an expert who can help them). They seem really excited as I share some of my expertise. I share just enough to get them excited but not everything - they know there's more. 
  
  3. I ask them if there's an opportunity for me to help them. They seem excited, so I ask them about their budget constraints. 
  
  4. I let them know there's mutual interest and that I'll follow-up in 24 hours with a proposal. 
  
  5. I send over a proposal that details my expertise, the company's goals, how I will add value, and logistics / comp. 
  
  6. They accept (no feedback!) and I send over a contract via Hellosign (make it as easy as possible for them to execute).

  Here it goes! 
  
  Once you’re on the call, you have two jobs: 
  
  1. Ask a lot of great questions 
  2. Validate yourself 
  
  Often by doing #1 well, you accomplish most of #2. Let's walk through an example:  
  
  If I'm an expert in scaling businesses without adding lots of headcount, I can ask smart questions along this line of business strategy / expertise.  
  
  First, I want to understand the business's challenges. I can ask what their north star goal is over the next 6 months. I can ask what keeps them up at night. I can ask about their biggest pain point. 
  
  Then, I can ask further questions in my area of expertise and see how big of an issue it is. And since I'm an expert on this topic, I'm going to eventually ask questions that they haven't thought through, or don't know the answer to.  
  
  This validates me as an expert, and highlights any weaknesses in their business. If the business is having trouble in this area, they might need my help. 
  
  Your goal is to get a solid sense of where they're at and learn as much as you can about their business and challenges.  
  
  Once I have this down (assuming there's an opportunity), I can demonstrate my expertise. I can share in my past how we solved this same problem. I can share an insight or two (you don't need to give everything away) but I want them to know I've been there, done that. 
  
  As you learn about them, take detailed notes. You'll need these for your proposal. 
  
  If you decide there's an opportunity to help them out, use your notes to write a kick-ass proposal.  
  
  If you decide there's not a great match between their challenges and your area of expertise, ask if they can make an intro or two to someone in their network that might have some business challenges aligned with your area of expertise.

  Here's a small excerpt: 
  
  The first thing to consider is what you're optimizing for. As an example, are you optimizing for income, more free time, more flexibility? 
  
  Consulting has its pros and cons.  
  
  You're your own boss, you choose who you work with, you choose your projects, you set your own rates and you have all the flexibility you can imagine.  
  
  You'll also have multiple streams of income. So, if a client drops you or a project ends, you'll still have money coming in.  
  
  Remember, if you get fired or laid off from a W2 job, you'll lose your only source of income. 
  
  However, consulting can be a bit of a roller coaster at times. 
  Your consulting business often won't provide the level of stability that a W2 job generally does. You'll win clients. You'll lose clients. You'll have to market yourself consistently to get new clients. 
  
  Transitioning to consulting means you're starting your own business. Starting your own business also brings the added responsibilities of bookkeeping, taxes, finding health insurance, and working through your personal financials in a more robust way. 
  
  What it boils down to is: you're getting flexibility and freedom that can require a bit more work with less stability.",Nope

  This is a catch-up call to see what's going on in their lives and to ask about their company and their challenges.

  4 years of building up my own 6-figure business and helping thousands of others, here are my top 3 tips: 
  
  First, let's set the stage. There's no RIGHT way to do this. And as you acquire more experience, skills, and the ability to impact a company, you can charge as much as a client is willing to pay you.  
  
  If you can offer 40% more, you can charge 40% more. No more waiting for someone to promote you or some arbitrary bonus. You charge what value you bring, period. 
  
  With that, let's get to the tips. 
  
  1. Set your goal. What would  good  look like to you? If you want to earn $25k / month, then you know you need to price 2 clients around $12.5k / month or 3 clients around $8.3k / month. Know your floor and do not agree to anything below it. 
  
  2. Price according to the value you bring, not the time you spend. If you spend 5 hours per week but drive $100k / month worth of value, charge them for that value created (at least a portion of it). Not your time. 
  
  3. Constantly test the waters. Raise your rates with each new client. Test the boundaries. You have nothing to lose. If they say  no,  then you know you hit a ceiling and then let THEM counter (do not negotiate against yourself).

  I had a complete lack of structure. 
  
  I was used to getting up at a certain time, going to an office, needing to be in meetings, and having deadlines. 
  
  All of a sudden, that entire structure was gone. 
  
  And because I was working ~25 hours per week, I didn't need to be up at a certain time. If I wanted to sleep until noon and work from 1-4pm, I could. 
  
  And I did that a few times. It was fun. Until it wasn't. 
  
  I felt terrible.  
  
  I'm an ambitious person that wants to be pushing the ball forward, working on cool things and furthering my knowledge, experience, and value-add. 
  
  So, I put in my own structure. 
  
  I started a morning routine. I set my alarm for the same time every day. I'd work out in the morning. I'd journal and meditate. 
  
  I'd work for my consulting clients from 10am - 2pm each day with a break for lunch. I set meetings with myself the night before for important items to accomplish. 
  
  Then after 2pm I'd do one of the following: 
  
  1. Work on a passion project. I had a lot of start-up ideas and was validating them during this time 
  
  2. Enjoy one of my hobbies. I like to golf, play tennis, and hike to name a few. I enjoyed some down time. 
  
  If you're in a transition phase right now, consider it an incredible opportunity. It's a time to step back and reflect, and focus on yourself.

  You can position yourself well for this, and never have to do any outbound. Here are two ways. 
  
  (1) First, let your network them know what you're up to so when there is an opportunity, you can be top of mind. 
  
  For me, I let my network know via LinkedIn that I was consulting independently, and got a number of inbounds from old colleagues (some from YEARS ago) reaching out asking if he could help them.  
  
  One ended up being a $20k project for 4 weeks of work! 
  
  (2) Second, we’re going to give our extended network a reason to reach out to us.

  Once you've done that, share thoughts on your area of expertise in a LinkedIn post.  
  
  This isn't a note on LinkedIn that says HEY I'M CONSULTING LOOK AT ME!

  So many people do not want to do this. They don’t want to self-promote. But it's not self-promotion. You’re not saying how amazing you are.  
  
  You’re sharing something you learned that might be able to help others. Maybe you helped grow Dropbox’s legendary referral program and you want to share your top 5 learnings that other businesses could apply. 
  
  While what you know seems common sense to you, it's not to others, and you might get an incredibly positive response.

  5. Do some research to find companies that meet the attributes you listed. Venture backed companies are in Crunchbase, local companies are on Google. Spend an hour and get a list of 25 companies. 
  
  6. Reach out to those companies inquiring about their needs / problems. Do not sell yourself. Ask about them. People like talking about themselves. You’re more likely to get a response if you’re curious about them. 
  
  7. Schedule calls with anyone who responds. On the calls, ask questions about their problems. Be curious. Ask questions in your area of expertise. 
  
  8. If there’s an opportunity, let them know how you help companies. Be confident. Share an experience from the past where you solved a similar problem. 
  
  9. If there’s a fit, tell them you’ll follow-up with a proposal. 
  
  If you have 10 calls, you’re very likely to close at least one.  
  
  When you have a call where there’s not an opportunity, ask for two introductions. Follow-up with these people and make sure they do make intros for you. 
  
  Monetizing your free time isn't easy. Nobody is going to hand it to you. But with some smart work, you can absolutely make it happen.

  Same. But it's inconsistent. I never know when my next call will come in. 
  
  You could take that knowledge and be making $10k / month on retainer with the right clients instead.  
  
  Here’s how: 
  
  If you’re already making money from the expert networks, it’s clear that you have an area of expertise that is in demand. So if you’re worrying if you can get monthly retainers, you can put that concern to rest. 
  
  The key now is going out and getting your next client that’s going to pay you $5k or $10k or $15k per month. 
  
  The first thing we need to do is nail down your niche. What’s the area that you can add a unique value? 
  
  Next, we need to get that in front of potential clients that are the right fit for you.  
  
  So, nail down who would benefit the most from the value you add. Write it down and as many attributes of that client as possible. 
  
  Third, do some research and customized outreach. Ideally within your network there’s someone at the company you know. If not, that’s okay.  
  
  Call out a recent win of the company, let them know about your experience, and ask for a call. 
  
  If you can set-up 10 of these calls, you’re very likely to close a client.

  2. They’re not afraid of failure. They’re willing to put themselves out there, even if there’s the potential to get rejected or ignored. They silence that inner critic and overcome those fears. 
  
  3. They’re coachable. They’re willing to try new things, take and iterate on feedback so they can have a better chance of success.

  5 years ago, everything changed. 
  
  I now have a growing business, a passionate team supporting me, and this year we're on pace to do 8x what we did last year. 
  
  Here’s what changed: 
  
  1. First, I quit my job. I was sick of working for someone else and felt like I’d really reached my ceiling at my company. 
  
  It was time for starting my own thing, and it was time to give it everything I had. I was done with the false starts. 
  
  But going out on my own again started like any other time. I picked a problem I wanted to solve and researched the market. But here’s where everything changed. 
  
  2. Instead of building something, I started selling. I didn’t have a product. I wanted to validate demand before anything else happened. I talked to users. I asked about their problems. If relevant, I shared my solution. Some bought from me! Some didn't. Every call was a chance to learn. 
  
  3. I completely changed how I approached each day: the night before I wrote down the top priority for the next day: if nothing else happened that day, this is what I’d accomplish. 
  
  This is the biggest place I’d gotten stuck in the past: when I didn’t feel motivated, I would stop working on the idea. Any momentum I’d gotten was short lived. 
  
  But this time was different. I pushed through. In times of low motivation, I’d pull up my to-do list, and knock out ONE item. Anything to move the business forward. 
  
  4. To boost my confidence when I was struggling: I made a list of all the accomplishments I had.  
  
  Even the small ones, like choosing a domain name, talking to 10 users, making my first $100, etc. Whenever I was feeling down, I’d revisit the list of accomplishments. 
  
  5. I asked 5 former colleagues to be an informal “board of advisors” to me in exchange for a small amount of equity.  
  
  I met with them monthly, set goals for myself each month, reviewed performance, and asked for feedback. This forced me to stay on track, set and measure goals, and collaborate with other folks who cared about my success. 
  
  
  With Mylance, things were very slow at first. We didn’t have big revenues or crazy growth.  
  
  But we found customers, we learned a lot, and kept iterating. And in year 3, we’ve grown 8x what we did in year 2 (so far!). 
  
  The tactics listed above might seem small, but they make a huge difference for me. The difference between starting and stopping, and seeing my business through. 
  
  And they can be used whether you’re consulting, blogging, running an e-commerce business, or building a tech company.

  3-5 hours per week advisory 
  
  What the project looked like: 
  
  With an early stage start-up, I helped advise their leadership team (two co-founders) on how they could take their newly developed product to market. This looked like one call per week along with a bit of research that complimented the advice I was giving them.

  For this role I was completely remote, with one trip on-site to spend a full day with them. 
  
  More about equity compensation as an advisor: 
  
  If a founder is offering you equity, they’re thinking long-term (e.g.: what will be the impact of the work you are doing in 2, 3, 5, 10 years down the road?).  
  
  Be aware that if they’re VC backed, the VC might have a say in additional equity being offered. Focus on pinpointing what role you’re going to play, how bought in you are, and your impact on the company.  
  
  When you really seek to understand the Founder’s side, you’ll have better success in coming around to an agreeable result. 
  
  Additionally, keep these concepts in mind: 
  
  Types of Equity 
  
  Incentive stock options: may have better tax treatment than non-qualified stock options (be sure to contact a tax professional for details applicable to your personal situation!) 
  
  Non-qualified stock options: does not qualify for favorable tax treatment for the consultant

9/24/2022,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6979424302051848192,"A $34k / month consulting project: 
  
  9 months into my consulting journey it was clear to me I was providing a ton of value to my clients, and I didn't need to be full-time to do it. I already had 5 or so engagements under my belt, and by this time I had also found a business partner. 
  
  Through networking, we got into contact with a freight company who’d been around for a number of years and while they were doing well from a revenue perspective, they hadn’t grown much over the last 2 years. They needed to shake things up, but they didn’t know how. 
  
  Within the first 10 minutes of our intro call, based on the questions we were asking, it was clear this company needed our help, and they needed it badly.  
  
  They are based in Tampa, FL, a market that doesn’t have a big tech scene and isn’t the easiest place to convince people to move to, which meant our experience was very valuable to them. 
  
  My partner and I debated how much we should charge them for a part-time, advisory project. We knew we could add a ton of value for them, and wanted to make sure we captured that value in a retainer.  
  
  We emailed the CEO with a proposal for the projects we’d work on, for which we would charge $40,000 per month for 3 months. I’ve since learned to be specific with your number. ($40,000 sounds made up. $41,750 sounds calculated.) 
  
  Then came the waiting game. Would they laugh us out of the room? Would they be offended at that price? A few hours later, the CEO came back, thanked us for the proposal, and said he’d talk it over with his board of advisors.  
  
  We jumped on a call with him a few days later where he told us he thought the price was a little rich, and that he wanted to get down to $30,000. We told him we couldn't give him that big of a discount from $40,000 (that's a 25% cut!), but we could give a 13% discount to get to $34,800 and we’d start with a 30 day trial so if it wasn’t working, he could ramp it down. 
  
  A few days later, we got this email, “We are good to go at a $34,800 monthly rate with a 30 day trial. I will be out of the office tomorrow and Thursday but back on Friday. Confer with your partner and let’s schedule a kick-off session.”

  The big takeaway → you never know what’s possible until you ask for it. You’ve worked on your craft over many years, and your experience and skill sets took a lot of time and energy to build. You’ve earned your value already. Your experience is extremely valuable, especially to the company that doesn’t have access to it without you. The worst outcome is they say “no” and you settle on a lower price, or you walk away and find another client that’s worth your time. But if you don’t ask, you’ll never have a chance of getting a “yes”.",Nope

  Is it 100% mandatory? No. But you do want one. Here's why.  
  
  Clients want to check out who you are, your experiences, and your specific skills to see if they should talk to you or hire you.  
  
  And let's face it, LinkedIn doesn't get the job done. Everyone has a LinkedIn, it doesn't set you apart, and, more importantly, it doesn't showcase the specific consulting value you can add to a company.  
  
  It showcases your experiences, which are helpful, but what makes you uniquely you?  
  
  To make a great website for your consulting business, it needs to have some crucial aspects to portray yourself as a professional and make a potential client want to work with you. 
  
  
  1. How you uniquely add value to businesses 
  2. Your past experiences (validation) 
  3. Your bio - what makes you interesting?

  Over time, there's no doubt there will be more and more consultants because so many people want to work for themselves with flexibility.  
  
  So we do need to continually set ourselves apart. The good news is that as earlier adopters, you are ahead of the game because you can confidently pitch yourself, prospect, scope out engagements, and more easily close the deal.  
  
  Closing the deal is half the battle. It’s not ALL about your expertise and experience, it’s also about how well you go from intro, to scope, to proposal, to close. 
  
  As far as your expertise, you’re continually building on that with every project you do and every client you take on. You’re learning new things, you’re growing, your experience is expanding.  
  
  Your job is to continually refine your niche and pitch to reflect this. You’re only getting more experience and thus more valuable to your clients.  
  
  You can capture that in your niche and pitch to have it be more rich over time, making you more and more attractive to clients.  
  
  Your job is to stay in the top 1% of what you do. That might mean narrowing your niche or rounding out your experiences.  
  
  For example, if I’m an Operations expert but I get some product experience at one of my clients, now my Operations experience is bolstered by that. I’m now more powerful to a client because of my Product experience. You can apply this no matter your expertise.

  Once I started letting my network know via LinkedIn that I was consulting independently, I got a few folks from my past (some from YEARS ago) reaching out asking if I could help them. You never know who will come back to offer you a $20k project! 
  
  Your network needs to know what you're up to so when there is an opportunity, you can be top of mind.  
  
  To do this well, update your Linkedin with your accomplishments and your offering.  
  
  Once you've done that, post some thoughts on your area of expertise in a LinkedIn post. Do this frequently (every day if you're up for it!) you’ll be shocked at how many views you get. Some of these views turn into messages and some turn into potential clients.  
  
  Besides 30 minutes of your time, what do you have to lose? This isn't a note on LinkedIn that says HEY I'M CONSULTING LOOK AT ME!

  We want there to be, because that would make it easier to define and see what a future project could look like. 
  
  But there isn't. And it's up to you to work with the client to scope out a project that meets their needs that you can deliver on. 
  
  As an example, one of my clients was a super early stage technology company in the logistics space. They had built the technology, but they didn't know how to take it to market.

  From that, and working with hundreds of others to grow their consulting businesses, here are my top 5 learnings: 
  
  1. Clients have incredibly short attention spans. If you can’t get across what value you add and capture their attention in the first 60 seconds of your intro, you’ve lost them. Have a very polished and concise niche and verbal intro 
  
  2. Iteration on your niche is an ongoing experiment until you learn what works. I started to pay a ton of attention to what I said that would “capture” someone’s attention, and then use that going forward with others 
  
  3. The way to win a client on the phone is by asking very thoughtful and curious questions about their business in the area you’re an expert. You validate yourself while learning about their business so when the proposal stage comes, you’re very well equipped for them to say “wow, we need to hire this guy.” 
  
  4. In a negotiation, information is power. The more you learn, the better you do. Ask questions. Be curious. Anchor high, and don’t be afraid to ask for really big numbers. Seek out a “no” so you know you asked high enough. If and when they say “no,” do not negotiate against yourself. Ask for them to counter. 
  
  5. Set very clear boundaries with your client for the work you’ll be doing, and when you’ll be available. Do not just do everything they ask. They’ll take advantage of your time and you’ll work way more than you set out to. 
  
  Ok and a bonus sixth: pricing yourself is not about how many hours you’ll put in. It’s about the value you create to the client. If you create $50k per month in value in 2 hours per month, that’s great and you should get paid for that. The client is paying for years of learning, skill development, experiences, and expensive education. They’re not paying for 2 hours. They’re paying for years of development.",Nope

  3 years ago today I had an idea. That idea was to create a platform to power independent consultants. 
  
  I didn’t know what it would look like. I didn’t know how to get started. I had tried and failed to start a company many times before. What would make this time different? 
  
  I knew I need to “just get started” and put one foot in front of the other. 
  
  I also knew I needed the mindset that no matter what happened, I was going to make it a success. The only failure would be giving up. I had complete power over that, and it wasn’t going to happen. 
  
  So, I got started. I did one thing to push the business forward every day. And it was HARD. At the beginning with no customers, feedback, or partners, I lacked motivation at times. I struggled. But I kept going.  
  
  I planned my next step the night before and when I woke up, I knocked it out. And I got small wins. Like really small: choosing a name, buying a domain, launching our first website and eventually a bigger one: landing our first customer. 
  
  I kept a note of my wins (big and small) and referenced it when the going got tough.

  Here are 5 proven methods that work: 
  
  1. Network with past colleagues and managers - they know you, they know your work, and can hire you for a project on the spot 
  
  2. Network with a wider net - starting with previous coworkers is excellent, but don’t stop there. Reach out to friends, family, and professionals at other companies or in other fields. Have conversations. Be curious. You never know where it can lead. 
  
  3. Link your consulting niche on LinkedIn - get a simple website that communicates your consulting value (mine is here: https://mylance.co/bradley) and link it from your LinkedIn. Your LinkedIn gets dozens of hits per day. Give them an opportunity to see your consulting niche, and you might get inbounds 
  
  4. Share your thoughts on social (LinkedIn is best followed by Twitter) - you don’t need tens of thousands of social media followers to begin generating business. Even a few hundred dedicated followers can turn into leads if they fit your target audience. Share insights from past projects or jobs, changes to your industry, and other ideas that convey your niche expertise. Do not sell. Share information. Not only does this keep you top-of-mind for your followers, but it reinforces your expertise. 
  
  5. Partner with existing consultants - they have clients and work, and often are looking for people to team up with. Further, they see opportunities in other niches at their existing clients that might fit you. Join a community (like Mylance) that has talented freelancers with similar backgrounds",Nope
8/21/2022,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6967140006226182144,"We took a $1249 product and made it $12,000 by increasing the value 40x. Here's what we did. 
  
  First, I have to give kudos to Alex Hormozi - his book $100M offers inspired this change and changed my thinking about offers. Highly recommend to any founder, regardless of your product. 
  
  Previously we had a $1249 product that was a two week Bootcamp covering all the best practices for launching and growing your freelance consulting business. We ran it in cohorts with 8-12 people in them, and we got great feedback. The premise is: we’ll teach you how to get your next consulting client, and then you’ll go out and do it yourself. 
  
  And it worked incredibly well. We got a lot of great feedback. We had a ton of interest in the program, and $1200-$1500 was a price point many could afford. 
  
  After reading the book and chatting with a few other course creators, I realized the program wasn’t as good as it could be. It was missing the follow through.  
  
  It’s like teaching someone a skill but not helping them implement it or holding them accountable to following through. It’s like teaching someone how to play golf hitting into a net but not being there when they take it to the course. 
  
  So we decided to help them take it to the course. And now we had a whole new offering: we not only teach you the best practices for your consulting business, but we also hold your hand as you get your first or next client.  
  
  And you’re not just going to get any client, you’re going to get your next (at least) $10,000 / month client. Sometimes that’s an additional $10k per month from what you’re already making, and sometimes it’s your first $10k per month client. 
  
  To do this and do it well, we need to provide much more coaching. We need accountability, tactical coaching, and Executive Coaching since mindset is such a key part of up-leveling your business. So now we had additional costs, but we were also providing so much more value to the customer. 
  
  We started researching: what is the value of launching your consulting business? If you get a business that brings in $15k / month and you can increase it or decrease it as much as you choose, what is that worth to you?  
  
  To the people we spoke with, that was worth upwards of $50k.  
  
  But we weren’t going to charge that because we don’t need to and it would severely limit demand. So, after modeling out our costs, we decided on $12k as the total cost of the program, and if someone paid upfront, we’d charge just under $10k. 
  
  That way the program more than pays for itself with a customer’s first consulting client (which happens before the program even ends), and everybody wins. 
  
  And it’s working! Customers are signing up. They’re having great success, and they're referring their friends. 
  
  More importantly, we serve fewer customers with way higher value, giving them a super high touch, white glove service. 
  
  And that's how we successfully transitioned from a $1200 product to a $12k product by significantly increasing the value to our customer.",Nope

  I didn't want another job. Frankly, I never wanted another job.  
  
  But I wanted a back-up plan. A safety net.  
  
  I'm a risk taker, but a calculated risk taker. In the case going out on my own didn't work out, I wanted to know that I could go back, and what I could go back to. 
  
  This helped my confidence and imposter syndrome a ton. I saw my value in the market, and so when I reached out to clients for my consulting business, I felt like I had nothing to lose, and everything to gain.

  Here’s what I did: 
  
  As I did more customer interviews, I kept hearing the same thing: my friends and colleagues wanted to consult. They wanted to work for themselves, with flexibility, part-time, and make good money. 
  
  And I knew how to do that. I had been doing it for two years! 
  
  So after the 7th time I heard this, I told that colleague I could partner with her directly to help her launch her consulting business for a fee. 
  
  She was immediately in.  
  
  I didn’t talk about the product, features, or anything about the “how.” Why not? Because I had zero idea. I hadn’t thought about this at all. I just knew I could help her. 
  
  As I had more calls, I got more interest. It was time to figure out how to deliver this for them! 
  
  So I used what was easily at my disposal. I used Google Sheets for the content, Slack for communication, Google Cal for scheduling, and Zoom for our meetings. I also used Google Forms to get feedback. Every single one of those products was free! Ok, I think I paid for Zoom premium to get 60 min meetings. 
  
  And all of a sudden I had started a business. I had customers. I had revenue. And I built zero product. And by my second cohort, my NPS scores were through the roof.  
  
  Why did this work? It was about the outcome that I delivered for these customers, not a fancy product, beautiful design, or robust features.

  I didn't know how to approach this. It felt like a black box. But I wanted to give myself a chance. And to do that, I had to put at least a number of feelers out there.  
  
  So I did it in the most lightweight possible. I didn't make a website, come up with a company name, or design a logo.

  I feel the need to share my feelings about this to protect myself and other founders. Charging founders money for a “deep screening  call is wrong.

  Here's how I thought about it (and came up with $284/hr): 
  
  1. First, what were my financial goals? What would  good  look like for me? This I found out was key: we always want  more  and if we don't call out what success is for us, we'll never be happy. 
  
  2. What value was I creating my client? What impact would my work have on the business? This can be hard to exactly quantify, but it put me in the right frame of mind of value-based pricing, not charging for my time. 
  
  3. Ok that's great and all, but how did I come up with a number. Let's keep it simple: 
  
  1. I took my  ideal salary  if I were to get hired to an awesome role tomorrow (I shot high but was honest here) 
  2. Add in what an annual cash bonus might be 
  3. Add in what an annual equity value might be 
  4. Multiply by 140% (taking into account no PTO, and additional costs like health insurance, additional taxes, and business costs like a bookkeeper and software) 
  5. Divide by 48 weeks per year (4 weeks of vacation) and by 40 hours per week  
  
  Taking the above, we calculate: 
  
  1. $270,000 
  2. + $40,000 = $310,000 
  3. + $80,000 = $390,000 
  4. *1.4 = $546,000 
  5. /(48*40) = $284

  Some interesting quotes: 
  
  The biggest benefit to hiring a consultant is solving a problem that either you cannot solve on your own or would spend more time doing than is worth your effort. 
  
  
  Since they are recognized as subject-matter experts, they already have forward-looking strategies and goals on how to help a business expand more quickly. 
  
  
  The biggest benefit of hiring a consultant is the objectivity that they can bring to a business. 
  
  Consultants are positioned to generate the most value from perspective. They likely have seen how several companies have managed similar problems or opportunities and are not biased. 
  
  One of the biggest benefits to hiring a consultant is being able to tap into their wealth of knowledge and expertise for a fraction of the time (and oftentimes cost!) that it would take for you to do the task yourself.

  That couldn't be further from the truth. 
  
  One source of income can be taken away from you at any moment without any warning or wrong-doing on your end.  
  
  You might have already been laid off. At a minimum you've seen friends get laid off and you've asked yourself,  could that happen to me? 
  
  The fastest and easiest additional income stream is you. You are a finished product. Polished with years of experience. 
  
  Your experience is incredibly valuable. Companies would pay a ton to learn from you and avoid mistakes that you've already conquered. 
  
  What you need to get started: 
  
  1. Intention - what does  good  look like? 
  2. A well defined niche - where is your experience a value-add to a company? 
  3. Your offer - who's your ideal client, what will you do for them, and what will you charge? 
  4. Outreach. Do some networking. Set up 10 calls.

  Can I consult alongside a full-time job

  Is 10 hours per week enough to consult? 
  -For sure 
  
  Do I have enough experience to consult? 
  -Yes, you do 
  
  Do I have to be a good sales(wo)man to consult? 
  -No, you don't. You just have to communicate your value well 
  
  Is there a world in which I don't deliver for my clients? 
  -Probably not. That's your inner imposter voice talking to you 
  
  Is there a better time to start given I have so much going on right now? 
  -You tell me. How long have you wanted this? Is fear holding you back? Your business won't launch itself and if you don't take the time and make the investment, you might always be saying  not right now.

  I found a consulting client that maximized money for time. I worked 5-10 hours per week for them and brought in $8.5k per month. 
  
  I had to end my other consulting engagements and focus only on the one that was going to deliver this specific result so I could focus 90% of my time on Mylance.

  1. Talk to as many of my target customers as possible. Ask open-ended questions about their pain points, record the calls, listen intently and take notes. 
  
  2. Launch a landing page with a free offer (e.g., a newsletter, community, playbook, etc.) surrounding what I heard from the customer interviews and start collecting emails. 
  
  3. As I collected the emails, jump on a call with each customer to further validate their needs. 
  
  4. Start a community (so I could talk to more customers) and sell a product to solve one of their biggest needs. 
  
  Note: I wouldn't need to actually have built this product already. I'm just validating that they'd pay for it if I did have it.

  The first thing when asking for a raise in a consulting project: 
  What’s been the feedback thus far?  
  
  We recommend formally asking for it (we send out a form) and asking how you’re doing overall, with a rating 0-10, and then qualitative feedback for what’s been good and what you could do better 
  
  Assuming that the feedback is great (9 or 10 and a lot of positive qualitative feedback), you then want to do the following: 
  
  1. Summarize the work you’ve done for them and how it’s benefitted the company (really focus on the output and value you’ve driven) 
  Tell them that you want to keep working with them, value the relationship and them as a client, and tell them for you to keep working with them, you need to revisit compensation 
  
  2. Showcase the work you plan to do going forward and the value you’ll add (ideally this is more value than you previously summarized in the “what you did in the past”) 
  
  3. As you include the value that you’ll be adding, you can then ask for the new updated amount, and the timeline you’d like the comp to be adjusted on. Emphasize that you want to keep working with them, and feel this new arrangement is fair on both ends 
  
  What I would do is do it in a few phases: 
  
  A. Ask if it’s okay to send over a feedback form as you’d love to know how you’re doing and how you could improve 
  
  B. Assuming they say yes, send over the feedback form via email 
  After you get the feedback, start working on summarizing the past value you’ve created 
  
  C. Send over an email that summarizes the value you’ve added, and ask for a call to discuss the arrangement going forward 
  
  D. Assuming they agree to the call, send over your thoughts in an email before the call, letting them know you want to send them this info ahead of time so they can have some time to think about it before the call 
  
  E. Have the call where you address any questions or concerns, and agree on a go-forward plan 
  
  Easy enough, right?

6/23/2022,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6945802251214987264,"Can you get equity as a consultant to a start-up? 
  
  Short answer: yes. Here's what to consider: 
  
  1. Make sure if / when you leave, you have plenty of time to exercise your options (I got 10 years with one client) 
  
  2. They can’t actually issue shares until their board meets. You can ask when this is happening next, and make sure it’s before the raise / new 409a because it will affect your options strike price, and this could be a significant change. 
  
  3. How do I value equity? The start-up wants to quantify share value based on the preferred price (what investors are paying), and we know that’s not an accurate price. Further, which preferred price (they’ll want the upcoming raise, and you’ll want the previous raise). In my experience, these are all things you have to negotiate. And again, every start-up needs you way more than you need them, so if you don’t get a deal you’re okay with, it’s better to walk away. 
  
  4. Get your options / shares on Carta if they’re not already so you can see your shares transparently 
  
  5. To the extent possible, use the company’s lawyers. Using your own lawyer is expensive. If you have a quick question, Mylance has lawyers that can answer a quick question in our Legal topic. 
  
  6. How do I figure out a cash / equity split I’m okay with? 
  This entirely depends what you’re optimizing for. For me, I was optimizing for cash, and wanted to build out a small “portfolio” of equity in some start-ups, so I would go for 80% cash so I could support my life, and then still get some equity. If cash isn’t an issue, it makes sense to optimize for equity, especially where you really believe in the leadership team and mission of the company.

  Here's why it's so important to get right: 
  
  1. First impressions matter: how we present ourselves makes a material impact on how another person perceives us. 
  
  2. Attention spans have never been shorter. We have less than 30 seconds to pique someone's interest, whether they're talking to us, reading our resume, or browsing our personal website. 
  
  3. Global talent is more accessible than ever before, meaning competition is greater. We need to be in the top 1% of what we do so we stand out for a particular need, and still get high paying (5-figure per month) retainers. 
  
  4. It projects confidence. It shows clarity in your offering and your skillset, bringing confidence to the table. Confidence plays a huge role in getting that high figure salary or consulting gig, and cannot be understated.  
  
  We use our 1-2 sentence  niche  in numerous places: 
  
  1. At the start of every networking or intro call 
  2. To headline our proposals 
  3. On our personal websites or Mylance HQs 
  4. To headline our resumes 
  5. On our LinkedIn  
  6. In our email signatures  
  7. Casually talking to people (answering the question: what do you do?) 
  
  It's tough to come up with this 1-2 sentence on our own. We aren't good at being objective about what we bring to the table.

  -Sell a physical product (online or not) 
  -Sell your expertise 
  -Build software and get paying users (e.g., SaaS) 
  -Trade stocks or crypto 
  -Write content (blog, medium, etc.)

  But you want that extra income. And you want the flexibility of being your own boss.

  Odds are, if you're asking this question, these are imposter thoughts. Of course you can consult in your niche. You're getting paid good money to do full-time work. Why couldn't you get paid to carve out a portion of that and do part-time work? 
  
  But, you're not sure. You feel like an imposter. Let's face it - you're scared. 
  
  First, let's normalize this. It's 100% normal, common, and expected. 
  
  We're taught our entire lives to get a stable job, get promoted, move up, and then get another job. And you're sick of that. You want to work for yourself. On your own time. On projects that genuinely interest you. And most importantly, get paid for the VALUE you bring to the table. 
  
  I know. I was there. I worked through it and overcame it, and I know you can too. 
  
  What helped me is to write these thoughts down. Write down how you're feeling and what makes you scared. It's all normal. 
  
  Then, write down the worst case scenario. What is it? You'll get rejected by a client? You won't make it on your own? You'll have to go back to the corporate world? 
  
  When you read what you wrote, can you handle it? I bet you can, but only you can answer that. 
  
  My guess is, if you actually do this exercise, you'll see that you can handle the worst case scenario. But most won't actually do this exercise. And most won't actually launch their side businesses. Which camp are you?

  Successful consultants have two main things in common: 
  
  1. They have the confidence to put themselves out there 
  
  2. They've refined their niche to concisely present their value-add to a client 
  
  To do #1, you need to be okay with rejection. You're going to get told  no,  and you need to be okay with that. Many never put themselves out there because of this fear. 
  
  For #2, you need to invest in yourself. You need to spend the time, energy, and money to get this right. This could mean getting advice from a friend, but to really get it right, you likely need a coach to help you nail this down and differentiate your offering.  
  
  The brutally honest truth is the only person that's holding you back is you.

  The idea was in the travel space building a curated Yelp with recommendations only from your network.  
  
  Biggest problem: We didn't test an MVP before we built it. We just designed and built what we thought was the product people wanted. 
  
  We spent 9 months working on it. We held meetings at 5am before my co-founders had to go to their  day jobs.  We got 90% of the way through our MVP before we realized we hadn't fully validated that we were building a product people wanted. Our developer got a bigger role at his company, and it was over as quickly as it started. 
  
  Taking this learning into Mylance, my first products were completely manual. I wanted to test demand (actually collect customer money) before I built any software. 
  
  How did I do this? 
  
  1. Our first tax product had zero software - just a CPA managing customers' Quickbooks. It was $120/month, and nobody churned.  
  
  2. Our first Bootcamp was run completely via Google Sheets, Zoom, and Slack. It was $1249 and because the value prop was there, customers paid for it. And loved it. Nobody cared it wasn't a fancy software. 
  
  Lesson: validate your idea by finding a way to get paying customers without a fancy software. If you can't get someone to pay, you probably don't have a business.

  1. Raise your rate. I started out at $250/hr and am now at $1,000/hr. They will tell you you'll get fewer calls, and maybe you will, but I doubt I got 1/4th the number of calls, so I end up ahead. 
  
  2. Do not let them pro-rate the time. You blocked off an hour for this call, get paid for it.  
  
  3. Do not apply for projects that are not in your area of expertise. You won't get it, and it wastes your time. 
  
  4. When you do get one in your area of expertise, answer it quickly. Have a standard response for all of them in that area of expertise to save time. 
  
  5. If they ask you to do a group call with a bunch of clients, ask how many clients there are, and get paid per client that joins. You're not incentivized to share in a group setting when you could get paid way more by doing individual calls.

  I trusted in my abilities. I had learned and experienced a lot in my career, but I was still scared of the unknown, and of failure. 
  
  I had wanted to be my own boss forever. I was tired of working for someone else, not feeling valued fo my work, and I was sick of the corporate politics.  
  
  So leaving was my only choice. And after I left (and took a few months off) I started to put myself out there. I took my fear, I looked at it, and I put it to the side. It didn't go far away, but I put it far enough to the side that I could take steps forward. It was almost hard to look at my inbox after I'd send a cold email or a proposal.  
  
  Eventually, one hit. And a Series A company agreed to hire me as a part-time contractor for 25 hours per week. And for way more money than my previous full-time salary.

  I realized how hard it was, and if I didn't completely grit it out, I'd never get anywhere.  
  
  So I fully committed to it. I told myself no matter what happens, I was going to be running my own business.  
  
  So I listed out the next 5-10 things I needed to do, and I knocked them out, no matter how hard it was. 
  
  Not everything I did moved the business forward (a ton of learnings!) but each step I took moved me forward a little bit more. 
  
  4 things you do NOT need to do to start a business: 
  
  1. Spend hours on a business model 
  2. Make a deck 
  3. Design a logo 
  4. Spend weeks researching the market 
  
  (I did all of these, and they were not a good use of time!) 
  
  If you're looking to start any kind of business, here would be my first steps (all done in under a week): 
  
  1. Write down a problem you're excited about 
  
  2. Talk to users with that problem. Ask open ended questions to see how big of a pain point it is, what their alternatives are, etc. You want to make something 5-10x better 
  
  3. Do some research (1-2 days max) into how big the market is to see if there's a decent sized business there 
  
  4. Find a way to test your solution with zero product. Get up a landing page (in under 1 day), use a Google sheet or form, or something similar. Do not spend time and money building something fancy 
  
  5. Find a customer willing to pay you for your solution, even your janky one. My first customers were served with Slack, Zoom, and Google docs for a $1200 product. Most often, you don't need anything fancy. 
  
  I made it a goal to leave COVID running my own business. Failure wasn't an option. And here I am running Mylance every day. It's hard. It's gritty. And I'd have it no other way

2/16/2022,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6899818430820597760,"When I closed by first client making a full 6 figure salary in 25 hours per week, I felt lucky. It felt too good to be true. It wasn't, but I did make many mistakes along the way. Here are 5 mistakes I made that I would never do again: 
  
  1. I sent over a detailed deck for my proposal, which I spent a ton of time on. While it worked, it definitely wasn't required. I now send over Google doc proposals with 4 specific sections that's often only 1-1.5 pages 
  
  2. I agreed to an hourly rate where I kept a time sheet that they approved weekly. I also had to write what I did each day in that time. Never never never again. This misaligns incentives, forced me to keep track of my time, and created uncertainty how much I'd make each month. I moved to monthly retainers with every client after that. 
  
  3. I didn't put structure in place in my life, and early on felt aimless during many of my days. I didn't carve out time for things, I didn't own my calendar, and I didn't prioritize well. The lack of structure in working 25 hours per week, while amazing, caused some anxiety and existential thoughts. 
  
  4. I didn't have my  why  nailed down which made my question my success. Making a full salary in 25 hours per week felt surreal. And without a manager, colleagues, peers, etc., I constantly questioned if I was doing  well.  Having intentionality into  why  I do something and writing down what success to me looks like has helped me avoid needing external validating, and get it from within instead.

  To provide a bit of context, we raised ~$400k from Angels and one institution, and used this to get to the $500k number we wanted for the round. 
  
  For the $400k, I used my own AngelList syndicate (I set one up) that took no carry or management fees to simply collect everything easily and only put one spot on the cap table.

I started Mylance and initially built a tax and bookkeeping service for independent consultants. I was struggling to find new customers, and during these user interviews I kept being asked how I had success consulting and how they could do it too. 
  
  Finally, in the middle of one of those conversations, I told a colleague I could help her launch her consulting business and would be with her every step of the way, if she gave me 7.5% of her revenue for the first 6 months. She agreed on the spot.  
  
  The thought to do this previously had not crossed my mind. But I saw and opportunity and decided to go for it. 
  
  Now I needed a course! So I designed a curriculum, wrote up content, and starting working with her.  
  
  In my next conversations with users, I told them about my journey as a consultant and they all wanted to do it too. So I enrolled them in the course.

  I had many down days where I didn't feel like doing anything, and I would end up refining my cash flow model (for customers I didn't have yet) because it felt  productive.  It turns out, that was just me avoiding actually talking to real customers, to avoid the potential of being rejected or being told my idea sucks.  
  
  So I started making a plan the night before. If I didn't feel great, I would accomplish ONE thing that would move the business forward. And I stuck to it. So no matter how bad the day was, I accomplished that one thing. 
  
  Then, I created a list of accomplishments. This included incredibly small things like  bought a domain name  or  talked to 10 customers  or  made first version of the website live.  See that these are things I can control, not outcomes (like revenue targets). I'd go back to this list any time I was feeling down or like I wasn't making progress. 
  
  Many new entrepreneurs get stuck in this early phase, trying to find an idea to pursue, and spending time on things that don't matter (like making a beautiful logo or doing 20+ hours of research on a market).

  1. You can go an entire negotiation without discussing an hourly rate. In fact, it's preferred. If your discussion is about the value to the client and deliverables, you're way ahead. 
  
  2. Add in exit clauses so you're guaranteed a ramp-off period (2 months!) with a client, and you're never left  high and dry  with no clients all of a sudden. 
  
  3. Be clear on what  good  looks like for you. Our mindset is always  more  which sets us up to be unhappy. Know your floor and have the self-respect to stick to it. When it goes below, say  no. 
  
  4. Build an emotional connection with your client by seeking to understand their point of view.  
  
  5. Focus on what you can do for them. This isn't about you. This is about solving a problem for your client. Selling yourself misses their point entirely. 
  
  6. Go first, anchor high, and sound confident (whether you are or not) about that number. 
  
  7. If they throw out an offer you don't like. Politely decline it. They might negotiate against themselves and immediately throw out a higher number. 
  
  8. Don't negotiate against yourself. If they say  no,  ask them what they would propose. Don't throw out another number.

  The former thinks about the value of their time.  Well, if someone asked me for an hour of my time, how much would I charge?   
  
  While that's certainly one way to think about it, that doesn't value your experience or value-add. That's just your time. 
  
  Let's think about what happens when a company hires us for a task. What are they looking for us to accomplish? They're looking for a big change in their business. They want you to accomplish a goal, grow revenues, cut costs, improve processes, sign a new client, build a new app, etc.

  It didn't make sense to me. Why not? If I could help a company with my experience, why did it matter so much if I was part-time or full-time? 
  
  So, I tested the waters. And it worked. My first client was a venture-backed, Series A start-up that hired me at 25 hours per week and $250/hr. It was incredible. And it wasn't a fluke. It kept happening. 
  
  The keys for me were: 
  
  1. Find companies whose problems related directly to my experience. I could solve a specific issue for them, and help them avoid costly mistakes. 
  
  2. Go in confidently asking for a rate I was excited about. There's no structure for consulting. Ask for what you want, and work with the client to come to a rate and scope that works for both of you. 
  
  3. Keep at it. Of course I got rejected a lot. I probably  won  1 in 5 clients I talked to. Maybe. That's okay. That ONE client funded my entire life and then some. And when I had two, I had a huge month. Rejection is part of the job. Get used to it. It means you're pushing the boundaries.

  My friend David had been tied to his W2 full-time job in tech, and couldn't get away. He was always taught: go to college, go get a job, move up in that job, and keep working. Working is stable, and moving up the ladder is  what you do.   
  
  He'd always thought of himself as entrepreneurial, so he joined start-ups to feel like an entrepreneur.  
  
  But it wasn't the same. He found himself working his butt off to fulfill someone else's dream. To make someone else rich.  
  
  He didn't feel valued at work, and he hated the bureaucracy that inevitably grew as the company did. 
  
  The thought of going out on his own, while enticing, scared him. He didn't know if he could do it, he didn't know what it would look like, and despite me sharing my story with him countless times, he didn't bite. 
  
  So, he took another job at a promising Series A tech company. Initially he was excited -  If they become a unicorn, I'll be rich!  he told me.  
  
  But pretty quickly, he was miserable. He felt undervalued. He didn't enjoy the company politics, and the company's future was anything but guaranteed.  
  
  I offered him to go through our Mylance Accelerator at a discount if he promised to complete every activity. He finally obliged. 
  
  He completed every activity. He started using the techniques we taught him. 
  
  He had some great conversations, and pretty quickly, he closed his first client at $8500 / month for 10 hours per week of work.  
  
  He was ecstatic, but it was just the beginning. After his first client, he gained momentum. He closed another. And then another. 
  
  A few weeks later Accelerator, he shot me this text 
  
  I’m at $27.5K right now and trying to sign another $10K client. I think I’m close. I can't believe it took me this long to believe you 
  
  David has now quit his W2 job, and is consulting part-time. He's closing in on $40k / month, working less than 40 hours per week.

  Mylance is incredibly excited to welcome Bethany Swartwood as our Head of Tax and Business Legal! 
  
  Bethany comes to us with both a law degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a Chartered Accountant with the Institute of Chartered Accountants.  
  
  Most importantly, she's worked with over 3,500 independent consultants to optimize their business for taxes! She also has over 14 years in the professional services industry, the vast majority within Big 4 firms and most recently worked directly with independent consultants. 
  
  While her credentials are incredible, her passion for this work is undeniable. Below is an excerpt from her letter to our Mylance community: 
  
  I grew up in a home supported by a business of one: my step-father’s construction company. The income he earned from his work put food on our table, kept a roof over our heads, paid our medical bills, and gave us opportunities as children. I would watch my mother, a psychiatric social worker for the County, run around trying to figure out finances, taxes, business law, etc. for my step-dad’s business.  
  
  When times were good, they could try to hire multiple professionals to help; but when times were lean, my mother found the responsibility solely on her shoulders. It drained her, because it wasn’t her calling. But today, it’s mine. 
  
  Our mission here at Mylance is to provide self-employed business owners with the same level of support and security as an employee of a large corporation. You and your business deserve someone in your corner, and we would be honored if you chose Mylance to be that for you.

  More and more people are spinning up side hustles these days, especially since COVID as millions got laid off from their  secure  jobs. 
  
  There are a million ways to make money in addition to a salaried job, and the easiest I'd argue is selling your experience to help out a company on the side. You are the product.

  4. Reach out directly to folks you've worked with in the past. Ask them about their company and their challenges. Tell them what you're up to. If there's not a fit, ask them for an introduction to someone else. 
  
  5. Research companies that fit your target client. Do some LinkedIn stalking and cold reach out asking for a phone call. Use a one-line sentence to validate yourself in that outreach (that you detailed in step 2). 
  
  It may take a few conversations, but if you have 10 conversations, I bet you find your first client.  
  
  Have any tips to add?

  Neither seem to really get the job done. You want to show you're legit, detail out your past experiences, and validate yourself as a consultant. What you want is your own website.  
  
  We've identified 8 key components to a consulting website to accomplish your goals:  
  
  1. How you uniquely add value to businesses 
  2. Your past experiences (validation) 
  3. Your bio - what makes you interesting? 
  4. Sample projects or case studies 
  5. Expert opinions or content (optional) 
  6. Testimonials 
  7. Way to get in touch with you 
  8. Professional look and feel 
  
  We've detailed these out in our free guide we just published today (link in the comments) to read further. 
  
  Do you have a consulting website? How did you make yours?

You jump on an intro call and your goal is to validate yourself so they hire you. You do so by sharing insights into a problem they're having, or an experience you had in the past.  
  
  They're taking vigorous notes - they're learning from you! The problem arises when it keeps happening. They ask for another call. They ask you to jump on a customer call. They ask for a  sample go to market strategy for X product.  Where do you draw the line between validating yourself, and working for free? 
  
  My general rule of thumb is two 30 min intro calls max, and then I'm done sharing free information. I say  I'm happy to continue the conversation and use my experience to help your company. Let's come up with a formal arrangement, and I'll be happy to tell you everything you'd like to know. 
  
  I've never gotten push-back to this sentence, and it has helped me closed multiple clients. If they aren't willing to get a formal arrangement in place, then I walk away.  
  
  Lastly, it's worth your time to write up a sample case-study that you can send to prospective clients. You spend the time to create it one time, and then can use it dozens of times without extra work. It showcases the value you add without long calls or extra free work.

  It’s natural to be nervous when asking for money. You likely haven’t done it much in your life and there’s always fears around “worth” and rejection. Think about it this way - the worst they can say is “no.” In fact, if you don’t get a “no” at some point in the negotiation, you did something wrong. Why? Well, you left money on the table!

  Turns out that's one of the most basic things to do if you want to pick up a consulting project: update your LinkedIn with the value you offer to companies.  
  
  This doesn't mean you post HEY EVERYONE I'M CONSULTING HIRE ME HIRE ME!  
  
  It means sharing your area of expertise and how you add value.  
  
  This gives your network an opportunity to reach out to YOU about a project.

  This is why setting your rate as a consultant is one of the most exciting exercises. You're no longer having someone tell you how much you're worth, and waiting on someone else to give you a raise or a promotion.  
  
  Further, with a salary at a company, your starting salary is your anchor for your lifetime at the company. Raises are usually percentage increases from that base, and your salary usually doesn’t increase with the value you bring. You could bring in millions for your company, and only get $10k as a raise or bonus. 
  
  Once you become a freelancer, those days are over. As you acquire more experience, skills, and the ability to impact a company, you can charge as much as a client is willing to pay you. If you can offer 40% more, you can charge 40% more. No more waiting for someone to promote you or some arbitrary bonus. You charge what value you bring, period.",Nope

  That's why it's important to have clear intentions going in. 
  
  What are you looking to get out of your consulting business? 
  
   -Make more money?  
   -Experience working across different companies?  
   -Get a small equity portfolio?  
   -Learn a new skill? 
  
  Whatever it is for you, write it down and be clear on why you want to consult. It might be as simple as  I want to work for myself.  That's fine. Write it down. This will help you navigate difficult client situations. 
  
  For example, maybe you decide you want to consult so you can work with companies where you really align with their mission in solving a problem for a customer base you care about. In that case, when you find those clients, you might be willing to compromise on your rate a bit because it's not completely about the money. However, if you find yourself connected to a big company that doesn't fit into that bucket, you can feel comfortable asking for a lot more because that engagement would be more about paying the bills for you versus aligned with your mission.

Scared of putting myself out there. I wasn't sure if I could do it, and I wondered what would happen if I failed. 
  
  The more I've spoken to friends, colleagues, and peers, this seems to be a common thread: diminishing our accomplishments or having uncertainty about taking that next step. At Mylance we call in Imposter Thoughts (not imposter syndrome!). 
  
  When going out on your own, this fear is incredibly strong and present in so many, regardless of past professional accomplishments.

Worries that I wouldn't find another client. Worries that a client would re-negotiate with me. The unknown of going out on my own was incredibly scary, especially in the first few months. 
  
  Added to this fear was I didn't know what I was doing. I hadn't done it before. There wasn't a playbook. I was making it up as I went. 
  
  Situation after situation that came up, and I figured each one out. I was let go by a client. I did re-negotiate a deal. I found a new client, and then another.

  While we were completely different, it made for an incredible partnership. The BD side of consulting was never my favorite. I loved delivering on projects, but finding the clients and maintaining the relationship wasn't my forte.  
  
  But he loved it, and he'd set up calls and introductions every week with new potential clients for us. 
  
  I can't say I ever saw myself working with him because of how different we were, and yet it turned out to be the best partnership I could've asked for.

  1. Working for free. Your experience is valuable - don't sell yourself short. 
  
  2. Lack of alignment on scope. The more detailed you can get with what you'll deliver, the more you're set up for success. 
  
  3. Selling yourself to a client. Nobody likes to be sold to. Validate yourself by asking great questions in your area of expertise. 
  
  4. Market yourself as a  jack of all trades.  Doing this makes it impossible to differentiate yourself. Set a niche and stand out. 
  
  5. Mingling personal and business finances. It's crucial to keep your revenue and expenses separate for tax purposes. 
  
  6. Charge hourly. Your incentives are misaligned with your clients. Monthly retainers align incentives and provide clarity to both sides on the financial outlay. 
  
  7. Lack of personal structure. Working for yourself, as empowering as it is, comes with its challenges. Set meetings with yourself, plan out your day the night before, and come up with a structure that works for you. 
  
  8. Lack of an agreement. Always sign an agreement. Yes, for legal protection, but also to make sure expectations are set.

  As a freelancer trying to contract with a company, you need to differentiate yourself. There are a few ways you can do this: 
  
  1. Get super niche  
  2. Point to impressive accomplishments you've had with other companies 
  3. Help me understand the tangible impact you can make on my company 
  
  Whatever you do, this cold outreach isn't going to get you very far. It's a numbers game yes, but the more curated and differentiated your message is, the better return you're going to have on your outreaches.

  1. Spell names correctly, and don't have spelling or grammar mistakes. A leader is immediately thinking how you'll interface with customers, and if you have errors in your application, that's likely to translate down the road. 
  
  2. Customize your message to the company. Everyone knows a generic message when they see it. If you really want to work for that company, do research and write a compelling note describing why you care about their customers or what problem they're solving.  
  
  3. Make it about the company, not about you. I'm a founder building a company. It might be a great opportunity for you, but that's not the reason I'm going to hire you. I'll hire you because you can help build this business and add value.  
  
  4. Don't lie or make things up. If you don't know the values of the company, don't tell a founder you believe in their values. It's not true, and they'll know it's BS. Be genuine. Be truthful. Be honest. Be yourself.

It's not an easy exercise for our customers, but one they find immensely valuable given it's one of the most challenging and intimidating aspects of closing a great consulting gig. 
  
  Some key takeaways: 
  
  1. Make it easy on your client to say yes. Clearly scope out deliverables and a monthly fee they can understand and accept 
  
  2. Come prepared with your offer, knowing where you're going to anchor, where your floor is, and other things you can use to your advantage to get them across the finish line (e.g., length of term) 
  
  3. Negotiate from a position of confidence and strength. Your accomplishments are impressive and you bring immense value. Having that come across in your language and tone means everything 
  
  4. Don't negotiate against yourself, ever. If you make an offer and they push-back, make them counter 
  
  5. Never work for free. Your experience is valuable. Don't ever sell yourself short 
  
  6. I recommend going first. Dictate the negotiation, and set the anchor 
  
  7. Seek to understand your client and build a rapport with them. Use tactical empathy to your advantage - you're more likely to get what you want

  Here's a snippet below, and the full article in the comments. 
    
  Fear and imposter syndrome. Fear never goes away, it only gets managed. Anyone who is in a leadership position and doesn't feel some fear is either lying to themselves or lying to others.  
  
  Imposter syndrome is extremely common, and not just for newer consultants. It causes people to doubt their accomplishments while facing a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud. It’s amazing how many smart, talented, hard-working people tell themselves, “I’m just lucky,” or “anyone can do what I’ve done.” This is rarely objectively true. We tend to downplay our own accomplishments, which holds us back. 
  
  Two things are key to combating fear and imposter syndrome. First, it helps to know that almost everyone faces these fears. That alone can be enough to let us move forward with less self-doubt. Second, it helps to see our accomplishments through others’ eyes. Simply hearing someone else read our resume aloud can help us to see ourselves in a new light.

  As I explored opportunities, I wondered if I could work for myself as a consultant. I had heard of other people doing it, and what did I have to lose by trying? 
  
  I messaged 12 different people on LinkedIn offering to help their businesses as a part-time consultant. These were either people that had reached out to me on LinkedIn for a role, or folks in my network. 
  
  11 of them either ignored me or said no. One responded with interest, and we jumped on a call.

  Consulting for myself enabled me to embrace that uncertainty, and work across a number of clients, so if one company got into tough shape and had to end the relationship, I always had 2-3 behind it to supplement my income. 
  
  I loved consulting for the freedom, flexibility, and fulfillment. Further, it was incredibly empowering to be the expert in the room helping the next generation of start-ups succeed and learn from my experiences.

  1. Get a high hourly rate. Don’t do anything for less than $300, and often if you do a few, you can go as high as $1,000/hr or more. Raise your rate consistently. 
  
  2. Don’t share anything they can’t find publicly. They’ll say they don’t want it, but they will likely ask anyways. Always feel free to decline to answer a question 
  
  3. Ask for 1 hour minimum for your time. Don’t let them pro-rate the session (unless it goes over an hour). You blocked off the hour and should get paid for the whole hour 
  
  4. If you don’t think the topic applies to you, don't bother filling out the form. It’s a waste of your time as they likely have hundreds of people they're asking about the same topic.

  Your first call is key to determine how well your area of expertise and experience fits with the company's biggest challenges. 
  
  If it's a great fit, they'll really need you, and you'll likely be able to get a high paying gig.  
  
  If not, it's probably best for you to move on and find a better fit. Even if you do agree with that client, you won't be negotiating from a position of strength - you always want to be needed more than you need them. 
  
  At the height of my consulting, I found 3-5 intro calls per week. Maybe 1 in 5 of those would follow-up with a proposal because I was very clear, and got better over time, in finding potential clients where my experience was an excellent fit for their challenges. 
  
  Then, I had a very high, (over 50%) rate on those proposals turning into high-paying gigs. The key is to filter really well at the beginning, and then invest heavily in those relationships.

  I know this is a tough time to be looking for a job. I'm seeing it from friends, colleagues, and all over Linkedin. 
  
  However, don't just apply to random openings that look good. It's likely a waste of time.  
  
  Here are some tips: 
  
  1. Quality over quantity. Research the company as much as you can. Decide if it's really a good fit and if you think you'd be happy there.  
  
  2. Use their names and spell them correctly.  
  
  3. If they gave you instructions for your application, follow them. It's competitive out there, and hiring managers / recruiters will use anything to help them narrow the list of candidates. 
  
  4. Do something to stand out while not being over the top annoying. Look up the profiles of the founder or hiring manager, and send them a nice note explaining what about the company or role you're excited about, and ask if there's anything else you can do. 
  
  Don't blindly apply to jobs - it's a waste of your time and theirs. Put the time and effort in to make sure A) It's a job you actually want and B) that your application is actually appreciated.

  Here's why you should consider growing your freelance business: 
  
  1. You get to know the company, their leadership, their product, and how you might fit in before you join full-time 
  
  2. Consulting can be a way of life - you make your own hours, work on fulfilling projects, and there's great money to be had: often more than your full-time salary 
  
  3. You scope out the type of work you enjoy 
  
  4. You can use your experience across a number of companies instead of just one 
  
  5. (and my favorite) You earn your true market rate - no more waiting for that promotion or annual 3% raise. The more value you add, the more you can charge, plain and simple 
  
  Mylance customers who have gone out on their own are saying things like... 
  
  So far, Mylance has helped me build up my side income to $21,000, and more than doubled my income from my full time job. The best part - I work 20% of the hours”

  Often, they're not able to recruit the best person for the job. Or they can, but it takes months to pull it off. 
  
  What about hiring part-time consultants for your business?  
  
  It can be much easier to find an amazing talent with extensive experience for 15-20 hours per week and bring them on as a contractor. Let's look at the benefits: 
  
  1. You actually get that person with amazing experience, where you may not have been able to hire them full-time 
  
  2. You then get to benefit from their experience and their connections 
  
  3. They bring additional credibility to your company 
  
  4. You can flex up or down their involvement as your business fluctuates 
  
  Maybe they're expensive. Maybe they cost $15,000 per month. You bring them on for 3 months to set up a process or get a launch off the ground. That costs you $45k, whereas that person full-time might be $180k per year, plus benefits.  
  
  They not only contribute right away, but their impact is longer lasting as the structure they set up lives on.

  There was a strong willingness to pay (over $1000) for this product that helped them take their tech experience, and turn it into lucrative freelance gigs. I'm talking about $10k to $20k per month in part-time work.  
  
  It seemed crazy people were willing to pay that much. But, we weren't just selling a freelance bootcamp. We were selling a new way of working. A new way of supporting yourself and your family: 
  
  1. With flexibility 
  2. Earning your true value in the market 
  3. Working on projects you genuinely wanted to work on 
  
  Customers agreed to pay because they saw a life they wanted, and were willing to invest in the pursuit of that life. 
  
  When you think about it, that's inexpensive relative to other options that provide a similar outcome, like an MBA that costs over $100,000.  
  
  Recent bootcamp graduates are getting they money's worth: making more than their previous salaries in fewer hours, giving them incredible flexibility.  
  
  I know not everyone can afford the money for this transformation, and we're working to bring the cost down to help more people find fulfilling work.

  I get these questions a lot! 
  
  First, taking equity is 100% up to you. It depends what you want to optimize for and your client’s cash position. Do you want to optimize for take home cash, or are you open to an equity position in the company?  
  
  I generally took 20% of my comp in equity, and built out a small equity portfolio as I worked, which I thought was cool. 
  
  What to consider when taking stock options: 
  
  1. Make sure if / when you leave, you have plenty of time to exercise your options (I got 10 years with my last client) 
  
  2. They can’t actually issue shares until their board meets. You can ask when this is happening next, and make sure it’s before the raise / new 409a because it will affect your options strike price, and this could be a significant change 
  
  3. Get your options / shares on Carta if they’re not already so you can see your shares transparently 
  
  4. To the extent possible, use the company’s lawyers for agreements and questions. Using your own lawyer is expensive. If you have a quick question that can be answered over Slack, Mylance has lawyers that can answer a quick question over Slack

  To that end, Mylance has a three week bootcamp that teaches you everything you need to know to launch your freelance business.  
  
  This includes honing your niche, setting your rate, finding and pitching clients, and setting up your business properly, in addition to live feedback and sessions with experts: freelance accounting, executive coaching, personal branding, negotiation, and more. 
  
  Because it's so hands on with myself and our coaching experts, we have to charge quite a bit to make it work. 
  
  We're building out a lower cost offering that gives you a similar offering: playbook to launch your freelance business, answers to all the questions you have about freelancing, access to experts, weekly webinars, a community of talented freelancers, and access to freelance projects for a lower cost, monthly subscription.

  I learned this week that we had misaligned expectations with a customer, and we didn't deliver how we intended. It's always hard to hear customer feedback, and especially when it's your company.  
  
  After taking it hard at first, I started to process it, lean into it, learn from it, and make it right. There were two actions that came out of this: 
  
  1. How do we make our product that much better given the feedback from this customer?  
  2. How do I make it right with that unsatisfied customer? 
  
  I'm happy to say we've acted on the feedback, and I reached out personally to that customer to find a resolution that we're both happy with. To the point that he said he'd consider investing in our company!

  This has an unmeasurable emotional toll on everyone and it's hard to stay focused on pretty much anything.  
  
  For me, this makes time where I can focus that much more important. I need to stay productive and keep moving forward. Below I'm sharing 4 tricks I use to keep my work-life efficient:  
  
  1. Use Calendly to schedule meetings, don’t go back and forth via email 
  2. Block off dates and times for no-meetings. I usually block off before 12pm and then Tuesdays and Thursdays for no meetings 
  3. Don’t check email throughout the day. Check it 2-3 times per day at specific times and don’t check it otherwise (this one is so hard, but makes a huge difference) 
  4. aText is a “Text expander” for messages you commonly send. E.g., I have one that goes “I have my availability in Calendly here, or you can let me know some times that work and I’ll send over an invite.” This takes 2 seconds to  write  with aText, and people book time without another message.

Currently writing up the timeline for how you close your first consulting client, and what you should be thinking each step of the way. Here's a preview: 
  
  1. Make a connection 
  Some kind of validation, either a mutual connection vouches for you, or at least you communicate your accomplishments and experiences so they’re excited to talk to you. 
  
  2. Jump on a call (or two) 
  Get to know each other, build a rapport, and ask great questions about their business in your area of expertise. Get a full understanding of their business through your questions while throwing in some thoughts to pique their interest and validate your expertise. Find out the decision maker to hire someone, their willingness to pay cash and their budget for this project, and how big of a challenge your area of expertise is to their business 
  
  4. Send over a proposal 
  Communicate your value again, summarize the company’s challenges using as many of their words as possible, and define how you’ll solve their challenges. 
  
  5. Negotiate terms 
  Remember they need you more than you need them. Go in with a specific starting point (e.g., $2470 per week for 10 hours) and know what you’re willing to go down to (both in rate and hours per week)

For his freelancing business, the average company pays him $2500 a month, and he has a number of clients in this range. 
  
  After diving into his offering, telling me how unique his skillset is, and what a differentiator it is for his clients, I told him he could charge more, probably a lot more.  
  
  I helped him think about it as the company needs him a lot more than he needs that company, and there will always be more clients for his skillset. 
  
 He thought about it and told me he might go for $3500 a month. I told him to go for $5000.

  Joining a company full-time is one of the biggest decisions you make in your life. You probably only make it a few times, and joining the wrong company (mission, culture, compensation, your value, etc.) is a huge mistake for both you and the company. 
  
  By contracting at a company first for a few months, you both get to know each other, try it out, and determine if it's a good fit. If it is a fit, you'll likely get a much better offer, be placed in the ideal spot (for you and the company), and have a longer tenure there.

I've been offered consulting gigs I wasn't even looking for just because I was interested in someone else's business.

The plane is slightly delayed, but it’s no big deal. I’m on #United in group 3. As I move up in line to board, they start putting bag tags on roller boards. As they go to take my bag, I ask if the overheads are full. I get back “I don’t know, I’m not on the plane.” I ask if I can bring mine on the plane to hopefully find a spot. She says “go ahead.” I get on the plane and she is now in the front greeting passengers. She takes my bag tag from my bag as I tell her I’m fairly confident I can make room. She says, “I hope you don’t, and you sit on it the entire flight.”  
  
  I say a sarcastic “I hope so too.” I get on board, and there are at least 20 spots open for large carry-on bags. I take one easily and take my seat. Dozens of other people behind me are murmuring asking why they checked the bags when many bins are empty.

  4. I didn't negotiate against myself. When they said my number was too high, I asked them to counter. They countered with $250 / hr. And we made the deal. 
  
  5. I asked if they were open to part-time. They wanted a full-time person. I told them honestly that I wasn't up for that, but that I could solve their problems part-time.

  Uber partnered with a few restaurants in each city, and ahead of the lunchtime rush, Uber would pack driver's cars with hot meals.

  Here’s how I did it: 
  
  
  Working with companies like Third Bridge, Guidepoint, and GLG showed me how valuable my expertise was. Those “Expert Network” companies match you with an investor or researcher who wants to learn more about the space. And they wanted to learn it from me! (And probably thousands of others).

  So I got to thinking: what do companies need that’s similar in nature but would require them to bring me on for months?

  The biggest key for me to have success in this: I narrowed down my value-add. I spoke to only my most impressive career accomplishments, and told them based on that experience, how I could help them win, avoiding the mistakes I’d learned from at Uber. 
  
  And it worked. Over 2 years I averaged $25k / month in only 25 hours per week.

  In October 2018, I quit Uber, and immediately 7x'd my hourly rate.  
  
  That's not a typo. I went to $250 / hour, meaning by working 25 hours per week (38% of the time of my full-time Uber job), I was making 3x as much money.

  Here's what really went on in the first two years of growing the company: 
  
  1. We did most things manually. We didn't have much tech at the beginning, so we onboarded customers, changed prices, and moved loads manually, just like any other brokerage. 
  
  2. We pitched shippers on a vision. We didn't have any shipper tools yet. So we pitched them on what we were building, and offered them to be an early adopter. It worked. 
  
  3. We struggled with many aspects of a business that a normal start-up struggles with, such as tracking down our AR. We often were floating well into the 6-figures of cash that our customers owed us, and struggled to collect on it. 
  
  4. Hiring was really tough. Freight isn't a sexy industry, and we needed talented tech folks to build a disrupting company. We couldn't take folks from Uber's core business, so we had to hire externally, competing with all the other fancy tech companies. 
  
  5. Our data was a mess. We so badly wanted to see in-depth metrics like our funnel conversion. But getting clean data in a presentable manner was very difficult, incredibly time consuming, and frustrating for leaders across the company. 
  
  Uber Freight is now valued at over $4B just 5 years after launching.  
  
  But it started like any other start-up: gritty, challenging, with setbacks, and pretty damn manual.","In the Freight space, Uber Freight is often seen as the  gold star  regarding digital brokerages and use of tech.

  Here's how I got that rate, and how you can maximize your earnings: 
  
  First, I established myself as an expert. I made profiles on each of the platforms and was very clear about my expertise at Uber in ridesharing, food delivery, and digital freight.  
  
  When they'd ask me to answer questions, I was very tactical in my responses about what I could talk about. No fluff here.  
  
  Then, I raised my rate. I told them I needed it to be $1,000 / hr and not pro-rated: if I was blocking off an hour, I was getting paid for it. 
  
  Here are my tips for you:  
  
  1. Raise your rate. I started out at $250/hr and am now at $1,000/hr. They will tell you you'll get fewer calls, and maybe you will, but I doubt I got 1/4th the number of calls, so I end up ahead. 
  
  2. Do not let them pro-rate the time. You blocked off an hour for this call, get paid for it.  
  
  3. Do not apply for projects that are not in your area of expertise. You won't get it, and it wastes your time. 
  
  4. When you do get one in your area of expertise, answer it quickly. Have a standard response for all of them in that area of expertise to save time. 
  
  5. If they ask you to do a group call with a bunch of clients, ask how many clients there are, and get paid per client that joins. You're not incentivized to share in a group setting when you could get paid way more by doing individual calls.  
  
  6. Do not answer questions you don't feel comfortable. They will say they don't want confidential info and then they'll ask anyways. Keep the boundary and decline to answer.

  3. Do not apply for projects that are not in your area of expertise. You won't get it, and it wastes your time. 
  
  4. When you do get one in your area of expertise, answer it quickly. Have a standard response for all of them in that area of expertise to save time. 
  
  5. If they ask you to do a group call with a bunch of clients, ask how many clients there are, and get paid per client that joins. You're not incentivized to share in a group setting when you could get paid way more by doing individual calls.  
  
  6. Do not answer questions you don't feel comfortable. They will say they don't want confidential info and then they'll ask anyways. Keep the boundary and decline to answer.

  During a call with a manager at a Series D Freight company, he told me they had a need for someone with tech and logistics experience to come in and help align their Ops and Product team in a 4 week project, and their budget was $5k.  
  
  For my goals at the time, that wasn't worth it. So, I emailed back saying I appreciated the interest, but I was going to out deliver the project scope, and thus would need a much higher rate.  
  
  His response: “try me, we’re not rigid with that budget.”  
  
  Ok then. I'll give it a shot. I wrote out a proposal, stating clearly what I would do that met their project requirements, and what I would do that went far above and beyond the project requirements.  
  
  I also noted why I was the best person for the job given I’d done almost identical work at Uber Freight successfully. I calculated with my hourly rate and how long I thought the project would take: I needed $21,300 to complete the project (giving them a 15% discount on my $250 / hr rate).  
  
  After an interview and a little bit of back and forth, they agreed to the project and the exact rate I proposed. What’s even better: while I was on this project, I got my hands a bit involved in some other work, and we agreed to a 3 month retainer afterwards at $5k / month for simple advisory work. 
  
  What I learned →  
  
  Just because there’s a stated budget for something doesn’t mean you can’t negotiate.  
  
  It is important to ask the client if their budget has any flexibility, because if there isn't any room, you don’t want to waste yours or their time.  
  
  All the companies I’ve negotiated with understand I need to value my time appropriately, and nobody has ever been offended for what I’ve asked, or if I have to politely decline the project because it doesn’t work for me.  
  
  Don’t forget that you’re in the driver seat here - your clients often need you more than you need them, and sometimes you’ll turn down some projects and that’s okay!  
  
  Stick to what's true for you and where you feel appropriately valued for the work. And when it doubt, simply ASK for what you want.

  Someone else in my shoes would've just turned down the project saying $5k wasn't enough. But I opened the door by telling them I'd deliver so much more, and that set me up to get a much higher valued project."

  I couldn’t have been more wrong. 
  
  First, at Uber I had access to incredible resources. The biggest one being Uber’s talent pool. I had the guidance of a GM. Help from the pricing team. Our PR team got us newspaper and radio placements. 
  
  And most importantly, I could pull Operations and Marketing talent from the cities teams to help us launch. This could not be more different when it’s your own company and you have to go find (and pay for!) great talent. 
  
  Second and most importantly, when launching a new city for Uber, the product already had product market fit. Sure it was still a ton of effort, late nights, and hustle to launch the city, but the product was proven. 
  
  If we followed the playbook well and customize it for our city, we’d success, and we knew how to grow the business unit (referrals, some paid marketing, and tons of organic “word of mouth” worked for Uber). 
  
  With my own company, I have to do EVERYTHING from scratch, starting with forming an entity, finding lawyers to help me issue equity and set things up properly, coming up with a not horrible name, building and launching a website, and finding money to fund all of that before anything has actually happened! 
  
  Once that’s all done, I need to find product market fit. This means doing tons of customer interviews and coming up with solutions. And once I have solutions, I need to test those solutions while still serving existing customers and keeping everything else afloat. 
  
  While I learned a ton and got an incredible experience launching Uber Eats in Miami and Milan, it paled in comparison to actually launching my own thing! Nothing can adequately prepare you for that. 
  
  My tip: make sure you have a support system (I got a team of advisors) and are really in love with the problem you’re solving - there’s no shortcuts along the way.","I thought launching Uber Eats in various cities prepared me for starting my own company.

  After months of learning and iterating, I've developed a 4 week bootcamp that walks through everything you need to know about freelance consulting. This includes how to find your niche, optimize your business for taxes, set your pricing, scope out projects, find and close clients, in addition to proposal and contract templates.  
  
  You'll leave the course with the materials and knowledge to start freelancing immediately, saving you ~6 months of learning on your own. Further, you're a part of the Mylance community forever. 
  
  The measure of success is that you're equipped and able to close your first client, whether that happens during the bootcamp or months after.  
  
  I'm already incredibly impressed with the caliber of folks in our June 1st cohort. We have a few slots left, so if you have strong professional experience and are interested, shoot us a note before the May 23rd deadline!

  4. I made some recruiting placements using my network to make 10% of their first year salary 
  
  5. I helped an early stage company go to market and get sold, getting a small cut of the transaction 
  
  6. I took the money I was making from consulting in 2019 to buy crypto when it was down 90%  
  
  7. I helped tech professionals launch their consulting business (this is how Mylance started), selling a Bootcamp for $1249 that was run using Slack, Zoom, and Google sheets 
  
  Note: I also tried about 50 other things that didn't work at all (travel company, blog, video content, selling a different course). Not everything I did worked, and that's okay. It's part of the process. 
  
  The future of work is diversified income across monetizing experiences and skills (consulting), content (courses, podcasts, nfts), and passive investments (physical real estate, crypto, and metaverse).

  Operations at Uber was a crucial part of the company, and I’d done some interesting things. But nobody outside of Uber knows what “Operations” really means.  
  
  So, I learned over time I had to narrow my niche and come up with a different way to communicate the value I add. 
  
  As a consultant today, I market myself as an automation expert that enables your marketplace to scale through product and process instead of headcount.  
  
  I target early-stage, logistics marketplaces. It seems narrowly focused, but there are hundreds of companies in that niche. And I only need 2-3 clients at one time to earn $25k / month. 
  
  2. I billed my first client hourly. 
  
  I kept a timesheet that had to be approved daily. The client was afraid to ask me things because I was “expensive” and I was incentivized to be inefficient with my work.  
  
  I never made this mistake again.

  3. Developing a grass-roots eater marketing plan. OK this part wasn't hard. Mostly what we did was email 1.5 million riders and tell them we were launching Uber Eats and gave free delivery for 2 weeks. 
  
  4. Testing, testing, and more testing the internal tools system to make sure it worked properly. It still broke the day we launched.

  1. Get $1,000/hr expert network calls 
  2. Become advisors to early stage start-ups 
  3. Attract and close consulting clients 
  
  For my Freight experience, here's my blurb: 
  
  I managed the Carrier Operations team for Uber Freight for nearly two years from our launch in January 2017 through October 2018, and have since been consulting for companies in the logistics and Freight space.  
  
  At Uber Freight, I built up the operations team, and played a key role in the initial strategy and operations. I became the Head of Carrier Operations, and in this role I shaped the direction of Uber Freight’s Carrier Strategy as it related to carrier acquisition and engagement, and played a key role in marketplace dynamics, pricing, product prioritization, and service expansion decisions.  
  
  Given that experience, and my current work with technology start-ups in the Freight and logistics space, I can speak to the Freight landscape, the impact on technology and tech start-ups in the space, and my best guess to what it will look like over the next 3-5 years.  
  
  It's incredibly effective and while it took me a while to come up with, it's paid for itself MANY times over.","I have a saved text that clearly communicates my experience in my niche that wins me consulting clients.  
  
  I end up using it ALL THE TIME. I'll share it below.

  I'll be honest: with my first client I got lucky. I didn't know what I was doing, I didn't have a refined niche or a great proposal, and I certainly didn't have a lot of confidence.  
  
  But what I did have that got me across the finish line was the willingness to put myself out there, ask for what I wanted, and be okay getting told  no.

  I shot high: I asked for $287 / hr. They said  no!  But they came back with $250 / hr at 25 hours per week. 
  
  And all of a sudden I had part-time work that was over 2x my Uber salary, free time, and flexibility that I'd always wanted.

7/19/2022,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6955262280926171136,"I had crazy imposter syndrome when I left Uber and started consulting for myself. Here's what it was like: 
  
  I was used to having a company behind me. I always wanted to perform well in my job, but I had a stable salary, I had supportive coworkers (mostly), and a strong sense of stability. 
  
  Leaving that felt a shattering. All of a sudden the only thing behind me was myself. I was responsible for everything: my structure, finding business, and delivering on what I said I would. 
  
  Here are 3 main things I did to manage it: 
  
  1. I hired a coach. All the top professionals in the world have a coach. I figured if I wanted to crush it, I'd get one too. It wasn't cheap. I spent over $8,000 the first time. It felt like a lot. In retrospect, it was one of the best investments I've ever made and easily paid for itself. It changed my life forever and I'm proud of myself for making that bet. 
  
  2. I outlined a daily and weekly structure for myself. I scheduled meetings for myself. I scheduled time off (much more fun than the meetings). I set aside specific times for specific tasks. I blocked off no-meeting heads down time. I made up a morning routine. I wasn't perfect with this routine, but the structure when I left corporate was incredibly helpful. 
  
  3. I wrote down my accomplishments. This may feel silly, but I somewhat lost sight of what  good  looked like. Without feedback or a manager, I didn't know how I was doing. So I set goals and wrote down my accomplishments. This helped me feel like I was doing  good  when I was only working 25 hours per week. 
  
  Over time, I gained confidence and could show up much better for my scoping calls and my clients. But it never fully goes away - it's something I practice each and every day, even as a founder now with a team. 
  
  Thinking of going out on your own? It's an exciting life full of flexibility and empowerment. But it's also tough at times, and important to set yourself up for success!","I had crazy imposter syndrome when I left Uber and started consulting for myself. Here's what it was like:

With Uber's global expansion, it made sense there would be a clear opportunity. But in 2016, there weren't clear paths to this. I had to make it happen myself. So here's what I did:  
  
  After I had launched Uber Eats in Miami, I saw that we were launching Uber Eats all over Europe. The problem was, I wasn't fluent in any of the languages of the markets we were launching, and that was a requirement for all the listed roles. 
  
  But, I applied anyways. I applied to the Madrid Uber Eats GM role. I knew I couldn't get it, but I figured it would at least get a recruiter on the phone. Once I got on a call, I told them I knew I wasn't a fit for the role, but that I had Uber Eats launch experience, and I wanted to help out with the European launches. The recruiter was confused, but she sent over my profile to the RGM of the region.  
  
  Once I got on the phone with him, I was in. He knew they needed help, few people in the company had Uber Eats launch experience already, and I was a willing participant to just HELP. 
  
  He told me if I wanted in, I should get on a plane to Amsterdam within a week. I didn't hesitate - I was in. 
  
  Once I got there, I helped with both the Madrid and Milan launches, and eventually got to own the Milan launch - one of the best (and most challenging) experiences of my professional life. 
  
  My biggest two learnings:  
  
  1. These opportunities don't land in your lap. And there might not be a straight forward path to getting it.  
  
  2. Don't make it about you. I didn't make it about me wanting international experience, my salary, my title, or anything else. I made it about how I could help the business line grow, which is what was important to Uber. 
  
  It starts with knowing what you want, putting yourself out there, and asking for it. The worst that could've happened in this situation was the recruiter was annoyed at me for wasting her time. I could've handled that if that was the case. 
  
  And instead, it led to an incredible experience I'll always have.

  To actually do it was terrifying.  
  
  What really got me over the edge was the thought of going my whole life not doing it. That would be far scarier than doing it and failing.  
  
  So I quit. And I put myself out there. 
  
  And incredible things happened. I consulted. I bought (and sold) an ecommerce business. I placed colleagues at companies and got small checks. I started a blog. And I eventually started Mylance. I also got rejected a lot along the way. It’s part of the journey.

  I was then told I had only 6 weeks to launch it (the fastest for an Uber Eats launch at that time). 
  
  Here are the 5 keys that enabled us make it happen: 
  
  1. I took the first two days to build out a launch plan. Many would jump right into executing. I spent time strategizing. How many restaurants did we need signed every day to be  on pace?  What about couriers? When did the PR execution need to start? Everything had a pre-defined date and I laid out a holistic project plan for each day of the 6 weeks. 
  
  2. We held a daily sales stand-up. Many might think this is overkill. It wasn't. We shared best practices that would help us catch up and keep on pace for the growth we needed. We needed 100 restaurants for launch, and I needed to make sure we didn't get too far behind. 
  
  3. I asked for and acquired the resources I knew I needed. I had recruited a launch team, but it wasn't enough. We needed more help, so I went to other city teams and asked for help from experts on the Rides business.  
  
  4. I eliminated noise. Anything that wasn't crucial to the basics of the launch was removed. This was harder than it sounds. The local Miami team told me we needed a huge launch party because Miami is a flashy city. It made sense to me, and I put the wheels in motion. 1 week later, I shut the whole thing down. People were upset with me. I don't blame them. But it wasn't core to the launch. So we had to get rid of it. 
  
  5. We hustled. We gritted it out. We worked weekends. We didn't take  no  for an answer. We called every single restaurant to make sure they were prepped before the launch. We tested every restaurant. We did whatever it took to succeed.

  2. I now had expertise that could benefit the company that not a ton of other folks had. I had Uber Eats launch experience. So, where were we launching next?

  4. Uber had an internal job board at the time. I saw the Uber Eats GM role listed for Madrid. Under the list of requirements was “must be a native Spanish speaker.” I was moderately conversational at best. I knew I couldn’t get the role. But, I applied anyways.

  Thus, my experience was the perfect fit for them. They could skip months of trial and error by bringing me on and leveraging what I'd already done. So was $25k / month a lot to them? No. Within a few months they could launch the marketplace, see growth, and show their investors they could hit that milestone with ease. 
  
  That helped them raise tens of millions more VC money in their Series B.

  I share this story to demonstrate the importance of finding clients that are in your niche where they feel LUCKY to have you. Where they need you way more than you need them.

  I gave an answer about how I felt I had enough experience, I had a lot of success at Uber, I found something I was passionate about, and I found a good business opportunity with a large market and problem. 
  
  The truth is, there's no  right  time to start your own business. And if you're waiting for  that great idea  then you're probably never going to get started. 
  
  Starting a business is about putting one foot in front of the other and just doing it. Deciding that no matter what, you want to build something, and nothing is going to deter you from that goal. 
  
  My mantra was  just get started  and then each day  do ONE thing that moves the business forward. 
  
  That helped me get through the tough days and tough times, and I'm so happy I did.

9/19/2022,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6977655144402292736,"I got a request to pitch a project. It looked perfect - right up my alley.  
  
  Then I looked at the budget: $5,000 for 4 weeks. Not worth it. I told them so. We ended up with a $21.3k project (always be specific!), with a $5k / month retainer afterwards. Here's what happened. 
  
  After being told about a part-time job platform called Catalant, I figured I’d check it out. I made a profile, and a few weeks later, got invited to pitch a project. I was inherently skeptical because I figured they invited hundreds to pitch for it, but after taking a look, I realized my Uber Freight experience would be extremely helpful to this company. 
  
  Then I saw the budget. $5,000 for four weeks. Not worth it. I emailed back saying I appreciated the interest, but with me, I was going to way out deliver the project scope, and thus would need a much higher rate. Their response: “try me, we’re not rigid with that budget.”  
  
  I figured why not. I wrote out a proposal, stating very clearly what I would do that met their project requirements, and what I would do that went far above and beyond the project requirements (this is why they needed to pay me way more than the $5k).  
  
  I also noted why I was the best person for the job given I’d done almost identical work at Uber Freight successfully. I calculated with my hourly rate and how long I thought the project would take, I needed $21,300 to complete the project (giving them a 15% discount on my $250 / hr rate).  
  
  After an interview and some back and forth, they agreed to the project. What’s even better, is while I was on this project, I got my hands a bit involved in some other work, and we agreed to a 3 month retainer afterwards for $5k / month, where they NEVER asked for a single thing despite me repeatedly letting them know I was available.  
  
  What I learned → just because there’s a stated budget for something doesn’t mean you can’t try to negotiate. It is important to ask the client if their budget has any flexibility, because if it doesn’t, you don’t want to waste your or their time.  
  
  All the companies I’ve negotiated with understand I need to value my time appropriately, and nobody has ever been offended for what I’ve asked for, or if I have to politely decline the project because it doesn’t work for me.  
  
  Don’t forget that you’re in the driver seat here - your clients often need you more than you need them, and sometimes you’ll turn down some projects and that’s ok!  
  
  Think about it from their side - would they want to hire someone who’s constantly thinking they’ve been ripped off or under-valued? Wouldn’t that be a substantial distraction to the work they need completed? 
  
  If you want a copy of the proposal I sent over to them, comment below and shoot me a DM and I'll send it over! 
  
  P.S. I do not recommend Catalant. For every story like this, there are 50 people who pitch projects and never win them. I got lucky. This story is about asking for your value and setting boundaries, not to immediately go sign up for Catalant.","I got a request to pitch a project. It looked perfect - right up my alley.

  But after 4.5 years and 3 business lines, I was ready to forge my own path, and in hindsight, it was a much easier transition than I expected: 
  
  1. First, I built up a back-up plan. I polished my resume and I interviewed at a few companies. If it didn't work out on my own, I wanted to know my worth in the market  
  
  2. I did a ton of 1-hour expert consulting calls through companies like Guidepoint, Third Bridge, Coleman, and Ridgetop Research. At $1,000 / hr, this was really nice supplemental income

  After 4.5 years at Uber in Operations, I quit my job to go out on my own. 
  
  This is what I would've written in Oct 2018. 
  
  Here's how the next 18 months played out: 
  
  I wanted to start a company. But I didn't have an idea I was passionate about.  
  
  I wondered if I could work part-time that would pay my bills while I figured out what company I'd start. 
  
  I didn't know how to find a client. But, I figured I'd do some outreach and see what happened. 
  
  I reached out to the last 11 hiring managers / recruiters that had messaged me on LinkedIn. 
  
  I was very honest with them: I told them I wasn't open to full-time, but that I could add value part-time given my experiences at Uber. 
  
  10 of them ignored me or said  no. 
  
  But 1 was open to it. 
  
  We jumped on a call. 
  
  After an interview and a proposal, I had my first client. They paid me $250 / hr for 25 hours per week ($25k / mo). 
  
  I couldn't believe it. It felt too good to be true. 
  
  It wasn't. Over the next 18 months I'd find over a dozen clients, all paying me a similar rate. 
  
  I became incredibly passionate about part-time work and helping others do it.

  After 4.5 years at Uber in Operations, I quit my job to go out on my own. 
  
  This is what I would've written in Oct 2018. 
  
  Here's how the next 18 months played out: 
  
  I wanted to start a company. But I didn't have an idea I was passionate about.  
  
  I wondered if I could work part-time that would pay my bills while I figured out what company I'd start. 
  
  I didn't know how to find a client. But, I figured I'd do some outreach and see what happened. 
  
  I reached out to the last 11 hiring managers / recruiters that had messaged me on LinkedIn. 
  
  I was very honest with them: I told them I wasn't open to full-time, but that I could add value part-time given my experiences at Uber. 
  
  10 of them ignored me or said  no. 
  
  But 1 was open to it. 
  
  We jumped on a call. 
  
  After an interview and a proposal, I had my first client. They paid me $250 / hr for 25 hours per week ($25k / mo). 
  
  I couldn't believe it. It felt too good to be true. 
  
  It wasn't. Over the next 18 months I'd find over a dozen clients, all paying me a similar rate. 
  
  I became incredibly passionate about part-time work and helping others do it.

And most importantly, I couldn't take the feeling that the value I created was way more than I was getting paid. And I was giving my all to the company.  
  
  That was how I felt in 2018 in my last year at Uber. I had built up a strong belief in my own abilities, and I decided I was ready to go out on my own. 
  
  I didn't line up another job. I didn't have a plan. I just quit. And I took time off, which was the most loving thing I could do for myself at that time. 
  
  And when I felt ready to work again, I put myself out there. I started a blog. I asked companies if I could consult for them part-time. I sold wine openers as part of an ecommerce company I acquired. I worked on a tech start-up with a few friends.  
  
  A lot of these things didn't pan out. But that didn't feel like failure. I was trying and learning. And that's exactly what I set out to do. 
  
  Then something stuck. I learned I could really help companies part-time, make a good living, and work only 20-25 hours per week. 
  
  And I learned I could help others do it. And I loved helping and coaching others.  
  
  So I started Mylance. Partially to solve my own problems as a consultant, and partially because I became incredibly passionate about part-time work, and I wanted to live and breathe helping others do the same. 
  
  The first step for me was realizing I wasn't fulfilled in my job, and that there was a whole other business world out there. When I left Uber, it was like the blindfold was taken off me. I saw an entire world of opportunity and SO many different ways to make money and add value.

  I found my first client through LinkedIn when a Series A company reached out to me for a full-time role. I politely told them I wasn’t interested in a full-time role, and asked if they’d be open to leveraging my experience in a part-time capacity. It turns out they had reached out to dozens of other ex-Uber folks before me. I was just the first to ask for what I wanted. 
  
  Three key pro-tips to help you get your first client:  
  
  1. Communicate what you’re offering, clearly. 
  2. Remind yourself: you have what it takes! 
  3. Just ask! Questions lead to opportunities. 
    
  1. Do the work to know what you can offer and be able to communicate what your skills and offerings are, clearly. And be specific: “I specialize in bringing together two and three-sided, B2B and B2B marketplaces” resonates a lot more with a potential client than “I work in Operations.”

  After 2 years of successful consulting, I would post on LinkedIn about some of my learnings. This yielded friends and former colleagues reaching out to me asking about my consulting. Through these conversations, I realized I had learned a lot and built up a real expertise in finding clients and closing 5-figure consulting deals. 
  
  So in the middle of one of the conversations, I told a former Uber colleague I could help her with her business every step of the way in exchange for a cut of the revenue I would help her make.  
  
  She immediately agreed! I had a customer! But no product. Whoops. Now I had to build out the content. So I got to work and started building out the steps she'd need to take to find her first client. 
  
  Over my subsequent conversations with other colleagues, I told them I had a course, and people immediately were excited and many enrolled. All of a sudden I had a course and paying customers. 
  
  One of my biggest learnings early on was engagement was low if my customers went through the course on their own. They needed a cohort, they needed deadlines, and they wanted to be held accountable. 
  
  Fast forward 24 months, we have helped hundreds of professionals launch and grow their independent consulting businesses, and have evolved into a full tech business with software and tax subscriptions to remove the admin burden. 
  
  Amazing things can happen when you just DO things and capitalize when opportunities come your way.

  It resulted in new business ideas, a strong loyalty to the company, and supported the city teams on the busiest night of the year.  
  
  Here's what went down: 
  
  1. They called it  Workation.  Uber would send out details a few weeks in advance where employees could pitch an idea for the business. 
  
  2. The top 100 ideas were selected, and the employees who submitted those ideas became project leads.  
  
  3. Over the next 2 weeks, project leads would assemble a team to support them in building their idea (with the goal to have a working prototype by the end). 
  
  4. The deal was: project leads got flights and $100 / day covered to anywhere in the world. Anyone on the project team got $100 / day, but had to pay for their own flight. 
  
  5. Teams spread across the globe from Dec 26 - Jan 5th to work on their projects, again with the idea of building a working prototype. 
  
  6. Given New Year's Eve is Uber's biggest day of the year, city team members were tasked with being  on call  to support in case anything broke. And something always broke. 
  
  7. After the Workation sprint, projects were submitted to HQ, which were evaluated on business impact and completeness, and winners were chosen. 
  
  A few Workation projects even made it into the app as features that still exist today! But more importantly, it built a sense of camaraderie with fellow employees that you might never meet otherwise. 
  
  Important to note that Workation was 100% optional and nothing was held against you if you didn't go. 
  
  Curious given the working environment today: what are your thoughts on this kind of project within a company?","Back when Travis was CEO, Uber incentivized a few hundred of its employees to work over the Christmas / NYE Holiday.  
  
  It resulted in new business ideas, a strong loyalty to the company, and supported the city teams on the busiest night of the year.  
  
  Here's what went down: 
  
  1. They called it  Workation.  Uber would send out details a few weeks in advance where employees could pitch an idea for the business. 
  
  2. The top 100 ideas were selected, and the employees who submitted those ideas became project leads.  
  
  3. Over the next 2 weeks, project leads would assemble a team to support them in building their idea (with the goal to have a working prototype by the end). 
  
  4. The deal was: project leads got flights and $100 / day covered to anywhere in the world. Anyone on the project team got $100 / day, but had to pay for their own flight. 
  
  5. Teams spread across the globe from Dec 26 - Jan 5th to work on their projects, again with the idea of building a working prototype. 
  
  6. Given New Year's Eve is Uber's biggest day of the year, city team members were tasked with being  on call  to support in case anything broke. And something always broke. 
  
  7. After the Workation sprint, projects were submitted to HQ, which were evaluated on business impact and completeness, and winners were chosen. 
  
  A few Workation projects even made it into the app as features that still exist today! But more importantly, it built a sense of camaraderie with fellow employees that you might never meet otherwise. 
  
  Important to note that Workation was 100% optional and nothing was held against you if you didn't go.

It turns out, the co-working space was actually an early stage start-up that was turning restaurant spaces into co-working spaces during the day. 
  
  Given how small the company was, the Head of Operations of the company happened to be there, and sponsored a Happy Hour for the folks working there.  
  
  I was curious about their business, and so I went over to talk to him. We got to chatting about the company, how they'd originally tested their model, and I started asking questions about how they were thinking about expansion, launch, and scale.  
  
  As I asked curious questions, I dove into areas where I'd become an expert at Uber. I asked questions and listened intently to his answers. As we went on, he started to have fewer thoughts about the deeper areas, and eventually turned it around on me, asking me what I thought they could do.  
  
  This was the perfect entry - I could answer his question, reference my Uber launch and scaling experience, and help him think about how he'd scale the business efficiently. 
  
  Afterwards, he gave me his card and told me to email him to set up time to talk to see if we could work something out. 
  
  You never know who you'll meet or how a conversation will go. Whether it's with an old friend, past manager, or stranger at a co-working space, asking curious questions around your area of expertise does a better job  selling  than any sales pitch you'll ever try.

  Here's the REAL story of how the Mylance Accelerator came to be: 
  
  When I originally founded Mylance, I started by solving MY biggest challenge as a consultant: bookkeeping and taxes.  
  
  So I found a CPA and launched that as a service (before we built any product). We found a few customers, but time after time during my customer calls I kept hearing  yeah yeah yeah but how do I get bigger deals and formalize my consulting business.   
  
  It kept happening. And finally, mid-conversation with a former Uber colleague I told her that I could help her launch her consulting business and be with her every step of the way. That I had steps set up to walk her through, and would give her feedback to navigate the black box that is consulting. 
  
  In turn, she'd give me a cut of her revenue for 6 months.  
  
  She immediately agreed. I was excited! But, I had fibbed a bit. I didn't actually have this product built out.  
  
  So I got to work, and I built it out as I sent her each module. And it worked. 
  
  And the next customers I spoke with, I told them I had a course to help them launch their consulting businesses. And they were excited. And they were in.  
  
  Fast forward 2.5 years, we've run 15 cohorts across hundreds of people helping them launch their consulting businesses. Some have gone on to build $40k+ / month consulting businesses! It's been challenging and rewarding and everything in between. 
  
  Two things I've heard a million times and actually came true: 
  
  1. Let your customers tell you want problem they want solved, and listen to them 
  
  2. You don't need a product to sell, just a value prop

  Uber would let anyone submit ideas, pick the top 100, and those  winners  would build out a small team to work on the idea for 7-10 days. 
  
  The teams would compete to build it as much as possible in that short time frame, and the top ideas would be presented to the entire company, with the best ones actually being built into the app. 
  
  I felt such loyalty to Uber in those years, and hundreds of employees spent their holiday time working on a new product or feature to move the company forward.  
  
  Some will say this was a toxic environment. That Uber made up such a huge part of our lives and we gave  too much  to the company. 
  
  But I don't feel that way. Nobody was forced to go on workation. I went because I wanted to. It was an incredible experience to work with really talented people on a life-changing product. 
  
  These days, that kind of experience at a company seems hard to find. And it's of course not perfect - nothing is.

8/1/2022,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6959936863469981696,"After two years at Uber, I was searching for a new challenge. On a call a manager told me about an opportunity and she followed it with:  I don't know what your role will be or your salary. If you need answers to those questions, don't take this opportunity.   
  
  I immediately jumped on a plane to San Francisco. Here's why. 
  
  The role was to launch Uber Freight in early 2017. After my experiences launching Uber Eats markets, I believed in myself, I was excited about something new, and I was willing to take the risk.  
  
  And I trusted the leadership that if I showed real value to the company, the rest (my position, salary, bonus, etc.) would take care of itself. 
  
  I came into the opportunity not knowing what to expect. When I got there, I saw a business that had barely been started: the small team was moving Freight loads manually (phone calls, emails, texts) and our in-house product was still in early design and development.  
  
  Further, we needed to do more user interviews to learn exactly what to build. So, just like any other start-up, we hit the ground. We flew to Dallas to interview truck drivers at truck stops. Yep - we pounded the pavement. We took notes. We asked questions. We listened. 
  
  Then, we hired a few truck drivers in house to learn directly from their experience. They sat in meetings. They contributed their thoughts. We listened. 
  
  I did what I knew best. I listened. I added value. I focused on automation, carrier acquisition, strategy, and the marketplace dynamics. I organized the team as much as possible, I spoke up in meetings (especially when I disagreed with a direction), and I worked hard.  
  
  It was a tough place to be: not knowing what my role truly was or how it would shape up. Of course there were other folks there all wondering the same. But I did my best to keep my head down and just add value. 
  
  Eventually, it came time to have those conversations. About roles, salaries, team management, org structures.  
  
  They did take care of me. I ended up leading our  Automation Team  working to get every Carrier and Shipper touchpoint in the app we had built. I loved this role: I got to lead an incredibly talented team of analysts on one of the most crucial components of the business: building a product led, automated Freight brokerage. 
  
  I also got an incredible experience - one that I was able to leverage into countless consulting gigs and to this day, am one of few folks who have extensive experience in both Tech and Freight. 
  
  The risk I took paid off tremendously, mostly from the experience more than anything else. Those kind of risks are scary. And they don't always pay off. But no matter what happens, you can learn a ton from them and get great experiences, which can often open up the door to a whole new opportunity.","After two years at Uber, I was searching for a new challenge.

  For how much hard work, hustle, and grit that was required to launch a new business line, I got very little upside.

  I was sick of building huge businesses where someone else reaped all of the financial benefits. I wanted to get that upside, and the only way I could get that is by building it for myself. 
  
  Once I got to that point, the obvious and only decision was to quit. 
  
  But before I quit, I learned my value at other companies. I polished my resume, did some networking, and did some interviewing. I learned my value in the marketplace. This was my fall back if I failed on my own, and made it easier to quit. 
  
  But I didn't fail on my own. I used consulting to fund my life and it worked incredibly well. It also gave me the flexibility to work on side projects, and eventually found a company.  
  
  Joining Uber was the best decision I had ever made. And then quitting Uber when I did, was right. I learned what I needed to learn and I was ready to work for myself.

7/11/2022,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6952289013399474176,"After launching Uber Eats in Miami, I launched Milan.  
  
  Here are some ways the Milan launch was completely different (and so much more difficult!) than Miami: 
  
  
  Unlike Miami, Milan had nearly zero Uber brand presence, no riders to tap into, and no driver base to utilize as supply. Thus, Uber Eats in Milan was more like launching a traditional start-up: there was very little we could leverage from the core Uber business. 
  
  Without millions of riders to email, we designed and executed a grassroots marketing campaign. We got OOH ads in a subway station, media placements on Spotify, and ran paid ads on Facebook. We also got some press in the main Milan newspaper. 
  
  The Italian team worked differently than I was used to. While I was used to a quick lunch at my desk, the team prioritized going out for lunches with no phone or computer time. While I loved this, it took some getting used to! I quickly learned I needed to adopt this cultural shift, or I’d risk alienating myself as the team lead.  
  
  As you might guess, in Milan they speak Italian. And unfortunately, I do not. Thus, I could not pitch in with the team where we were struggling. I had to be the best manager / cheerleader possible, make sure there was alignment and accountability, and stand behind them. 
  
  Pizza is one of the top delivery foods in the US. It’s one of the least desired delivery foods in Italy. In Italy, Italian food is something to experience. Not get delivered in 20 minutes. Italian restaurants were easy to close so our sales team went after those, when those were the least attractive restaurants to have on the platform. 
  
  The regulatory environment was incredibly sophisticated, hard to understand, and antiquated. It seemed like no arrangement would be “legal” so I eventually just picked one and we went with it. 
  
  Despite our marketing efforts, our launch day was 6% as big as Miami’s. It was an incredibly tough market with an amazing competitor in Deliveroo.  
  
  In retrospect, I’m not sure it was worth Uber’s time and resources to launch there in the first place.  
  
  But, we got through it in one of the most difficult experiences in my professional career!

1/10/2023,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7018660235061972992,"After I launched Uber Eats in Miami, Uber asked me if I wanted to interview for the Miami GM position - a dream job for me.  
  
  I happily interviewed. But after one round of interviews, I got rejected. 
  
  The launch had gone well. Why didn't I make it to even the second round? I was surprised and upset.  
  
  I asked for feedback. As much as it hurt, I wanted to learn why I didn't get the role. I found out they wanted someone with more managerial experience.  
  
  That hurt. They had asked ME if I wanted to interview. I guess it didn't matter that I had managed multiple teams already at Uber. And it didn't matter that I had just facilitated a great launch of the city. They had their criteria, and they stuck to it. 
  
  I was frustrated. It had been my dream to be a GM at Uber. But, it wasn't going to happen at that time. 
  
  As I tried to get another GM role, I got some tough feedback: don't go in asking for a position because you want it or it's good for you. A company hires you or promotes you because it will help THEM. The pitch needs to be about them. 
  
  I hadn't gone about this the right way, and I was ready to act on the feedback.  
  
  I had one thing that very few people at the company had: Uber Eats launch experience. Thus, I found out where we were going to launch next. All of Europe. Boom. I got in touch with the recruiter, shared my launch experience, and told her I could add value to THEM. 
  
  She saw that value, and put me in touch with the GM, who told me to get on a plane and get over to Amsterdam immediately.  
  
  Rejection is hard. It sucks. Nobody likes it. But, after you digest the hurt that comes with it, it's an opportunity to learn from the experience and grow from it.  
  
  I learned a valuable lesson, and as painful as it was, I know I'm better for it.","After I launched Uber Eats in Miami, Uber asked me if I wanted to interview for the Miami GM position - a dream job for me.

I was excited but nervous - didn't know what to expect. The nerves didn't last long - I was immediately confronted by my boss who was underwater with driver emails, driver payments, and a whole host of other fire drills.  
  
  I had left my cushy, well-paying consulting job to join this fast-paced start-up few people had heard of because I thought I'd learn a lot and it seemed like a cool product. 
  
  Fast forward 4 years: I got to manage 9 markets in the North Carolinas, launch Uber Eats in Miami and Milan, and launch and scale Uber Freight in the US. 
  
  Most importantly, I learned what I was capable of. I learned I had what it took to launch a business unit and run an Ops team. I learned I had a ton of grit and resolve to work through some incredibly difficult situations. And I learned I could hang with the best of them (them being my talented peers at Uber).

  After 4.5 years at Uber, I started helping start-ups on a contract basis and part-time, making more than my Uber salary in half the number of hours. Since then, I've helped dozens of others launch their freelance businesses, set their rates, scope out projects, and close clients. 
  
  I'm hosting a free live webinar Wednesday at 5pm PST, where I'll go through how I launched my freelance business, and how you can too!

  I started Mylance to help others take advantage of this way of working. We help experienced tech professionals navigate the black box that is independent consulting:  
  
  How do I present my skills and hone my niche? 
  How much should I charge? 
  Do I need an LLC? 
  How do I get equity in my clients? 
  Where do I draw the line between  helping for free  and setting up a formal arrangement? 
  What about a contract?

  After leaving Uber in 2018, I spun up a consulting business that funded my life while I explored other projects. 
  
  I earned ~$25k / month while I tested blogs, e-commerce, a travel tech company, writing, and more. 
  
  When I settled on the idea for Mylance in late 2019, I wound down consulting to only $10k / month in as few hours per week as possible, which funded my life while I was getting Mylance off the ground. 
  
  There's no right way to consult, but it sure is powerful when used correctly. 
  
  Today I'm hosting an AMA here in the comments. I'd love to help you find your next (or first) consulting client! Post your questions below and I'll get to each one throughout the day!","**AMA Alert!**

6/16/2021,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6810986687775297536," What do I have to lose?  might be the most powerful sentence I've ever asked myself. It allowed me to close my highest paying consulting project (to date).  
  
  Here's how I used it: 
  
  When we got introduced to the CEO, we initially did a great job  scoping the project  by asking tons of curious questions about where the company was struggling, and identifying where we could help (I was working with a business partner whom I'd met at Uber Freight).  
  
  After our scoping call, it was clear the client would benefit a ton from our expertise, so we decided to go big. What did we have to lose?  
  
  We sent over a proposal asking for $40k per month. 
  
  Note: I’ve since learned to be specific with your number. $40k sounds made up. $41.7k sounds calculated. But, we didn’t know better at the time. 
  
  He came back asking for $30k (we were shocked!) and while that was incredible, we didn't have much to lose to ask for more. We told him we couldn't take a 25% discount from $40k (anchored him) but instead could do a 12% discount to $35,200. 
  
  It worked, and we closed the deal. Adding to everything, we wrote in the contract they had to pay us up front, and they agreed no problem. The moment he slid a check across the table to us for $35,200 for 30 days of part-time work, I nearly lost it. 
  
  My top learnings from this experience:  
  
  1. You never know what's possible until you ask 
  
  2. You might bring something far greater to the table than you realize 
  
  3. Consulting is freaking amazing because you can capture the true value you bring, not what an employer says you're worth"," What do I have to lose?  might be the most powerful sentence I've ever asked myself. It allowed me to close my highest paying consulting project (to date).

  It's a question I get a lot. Here's my answer: 
  
  I've always had an entrepreneurial drive. I started and failed to build a company nearly a dozen times over the years. 
  
  When I left Uber, I left to build something on my own. Consulting for me was a bridge while I figured out what I wanted to build. And it was an amazing bridge: I learned a ton, I made great money, and I got to work with awesome people.  
  
  But the most important outcome was a new passion. A passion for part-time, flexible work where you can work for yourself, on your own time, make great money, and enjoy the work you're doing. 
  
  As I lived more in this world, I fell in love with it more. And I realized I had the perfect combination of passion and expertise in one topic. 
  
  And so I decided it was time to build, combining that passion and expertise, solving my own problems and being my own customer. 
  
  That's why I left consulting to start Mylance. I've always been a builder, and now I get the opportunity to build in a problem space I love, being fulfilled by helping amazing professionals grow their consulting businesses every single day."," If consulting was so lucrative, why'd you stop to build a company?

9/7/2022,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6973322765323964416," How do I package all my experiences so I can have an offer to consult? 
  
  You want $20k per month consulting? We need to nail this.  
  
  And it's the most common question I get from our customers. 
  
  So, let's break it down. 
  
  Our goal is to get hired by a company, just get hired part-time. 
  
  To do this, we need to 
  1. Differentiate ourselves 
  2. Clearly communicate what we bring to the table 
  3. Do #1 and #2 confidently. 
  
  Ideal customer 
  To do that well, I need to nail down my ideal client: who can I add an incredible amount of value to based on my experience? 
  
  The value I bring 
  Then, I can answer the question: what can I help them with? What problems can I solve for them that will help them achieve their goals? 
  
  Past experiences as validation 
  Based on my past experiences, how can I validate the value I wrote above? 
  
  This can look like the following: 
  1. My ideal customer is a Seed stage, marketplace start-up likely in food delivery or ride-sharing 
  
  2. I specialize in launching and scaling new markets including supply and demand side acquisition and marketplace dynamics 
  
  3. Given my experience launching Uber Eats in Miami and Milan, and Uber Freight in the US and growing it to a $1B valuation in 2 years 
  
  Ideal customer + value add + validation = success 
  
  And once you do these exercises and feel good about them, you'll be a hell of a lot more confident going into a client. 
  
  If you're looking for help with this - shoot me a note. I'm happy to help!"," How do I package all my experiences so I can have an offer to consult?
