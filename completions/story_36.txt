From making heavy investments in global expansion to launching Uber Eats in Miami, Uber worked hard to achieve profitability in Q4 2022. The journey wasn't without challenges, but the team behind Uber's growth should be proud of their successes. Despite the tough road they have taken, Uber has now accomplished huge milestones and delivered life-changing services around the world. Congratulations to the entire team!
