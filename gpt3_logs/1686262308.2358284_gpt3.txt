PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years. The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, 
making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. I will through the provided narrative in story, master 
and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will hold myself to the highest literary standards, and  my writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  


STORY:
================================

When we launched UberEATS in Miami, we were very concerned about Amazon Restaurants because they were Amazon. We spent quite a bit of time researching their offering to compete against them. Three years later, they’re shutting down.  
  
  If you’re launching a business that competes against a mammoth, don’t be overly worried. Out-strategize and out-execute them, and you may just be fine. You don’t know what resources they’re throwing at the problem, you don’t know where it sits on their priority list, and you certainly should not assume just because they’re successful at one thing, means they’ll be successful at all things. Don’t be afraid to go up against the big player - move fast, work hard, hire amazing talent, and you’ll have a good chance to win

  Amazon Restaurants shutting down should be a reminder to startups that it's possible to go up against the big players and win. When we launched UberEATS in Miami, we were very worried about Amazon Restaurants because of their size. We did our research and found that we could compete against them. Three years later, they're shutting down. This is a reminder that it's possible to out-strategize and out-execute the big players. You don't know what resources they're throwing at the problem or where it sits on their priority list. And just because they're successful at one thing doesn't mean they'll be successful at everything. So don't be afraid to go up against the big player. Move fast, work hard, and hire amazing talent, and you'll have a good chance to win.
