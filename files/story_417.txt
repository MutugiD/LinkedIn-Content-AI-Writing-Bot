All the time I get messages asking for help to close high-paying consulting gigs.  
  
  I love helping, but I often feel like a broken record in sharing these tips and techniques, and I'd love to help more all at the same time. 
  
  To that end, we've started a FREE newsletter at Mylance where we share a ton of these techniques, case studies of successful consultants, and market trends that we're seeing. 
  
  We know this is a tough time for many, and I'd love to share this content, whether it's about setting up your freelance business properly, branding yourself externally, imposter syndrome, or negotiating like a pro, we're got you covered.
