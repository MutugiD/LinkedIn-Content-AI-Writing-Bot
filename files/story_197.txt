I had 2-3 clients at one time and earned on average $25k per month. 
  
  After 2 years, I wound it down to only 1 client at $7k per month. 
  
  Why? I was ready to put all my efforts into my own start-up, and I wanted consulting to fund my life. 
  
  So I reduced my consulting income to only what was needed to pay my bills (I lived in SF at the time :/) so I could focus as much time on my start-up as possible. 
  
  For others in our Mylance community, consulting allows them to spend more time with their family, build up a side business, travel the world, work from anywhere on the planet, or spend more free time to pursue a passion. 
  
  It's incredibly powerful because you're the boss and you call the shots.  
  
  Many dream of doing this. But few actually make it their reality. It's a leap. It's not easy to get this off the ground. Those that do succeed commit to it. They invest in themselves. They take steps to move the ball forward, regardless of how hard it gets.  
  
  I've heard every excuse in the book. You can make excuses, or you can take steps forward. The choice is yours.
