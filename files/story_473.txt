Starting a business is incredibly difficult emotionally. More often than not, you're not sure what direction to go and you don't get recurring positive or constructive feedback (that you do as part of a larger team). You have to do your research, go with your gut, and believe you'll figure it out along the way.  
  
  If you know someone starting their own business - try to be positive and encouraging. Give them props for even trying it, whether you believe in their idea or not. 
  
  In many ways, I believe everyone is capable of exactly what they think they are, regardless of what anyone else says.
