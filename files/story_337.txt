I'm excited to share a big milestone for Mylance. Over the last year we've been helping tech professionals use their experience to work for themselves as independent consultants. While this has been rewarding, since the beginning we've wanted to build a scalable tech product to help millions of professionals work for themselves, and we now have the talent to do that. 
  
  I’m excited to announce we’ve hired Gerardo Raiden as our Founding Engineer. Gerardo comes to us with over 20 years of development and founder experience. He's started multiple companies, has successful exits, is an incredibly talented engineer, and an all-around great guy. This is a huge milestone for us, and I could not be more excited to welcome him to the team.  
  
  Much more to come in the coming weeks regarding our new product that will help grow and automate your freelance consulting business!
