 Can I consult in my niche? 
  
  Odds are, if you're asking this question, these are imposter thoughts. Of course you can consult in your niche. You're getting paid good money to do full-time work. Why couldn't you get paid to carve out a portion of that and do part-time work? 
  
  But, you're not sure. You feel like an imposter. Let's face it - you're scared. 
  
  First, let's normalize this. It's 100% normal, common, and expected. 
  
  We're taught our entire lives to get a stable job, get promoted, move up, and then get another job. And you're sick of that. You want to work for yourself. On your own time. On projects that genuinely interest you. And most importantly, get paid for the VALUE you bring to the table. 
  
  I know. I was there. I worked through it and overcame it, and I know you can too. 
  
  What helped me is to write these thoughts down. Write down how you're feeling and what makes you scared. It's all normal. 
  
  Then, write down the worst case scenario. What is it? You'll get rejected by a client? You won't make it on your own? You'll have to go back to the corporate world? 
  
  When you read what you wrote, can you handle it? I bet you can, but only you can answer that. 
  
  My guess is, if you actually do this exercise, you'll see that you can handle the worst case scenario. But most won't actually do this exercise. And most won't actually launch their side businesses. Which camp are you?
