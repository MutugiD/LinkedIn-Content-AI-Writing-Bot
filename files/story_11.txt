When I left Uber and started to consult, I heard time and time again  you can't possibly freelance consult in Operations.  It just didn't compute: they had always heard that independent consulting was for designers and engineers, so that's what they took as fact. 
  
  I didn't really know what was possible, and figured I'd give it a shot. I'd see if I could find a part-time project in Operations given my experience and skillset. And my first client was a Series A company who essentially needed a Head of Operations, and they let me do the role in 25 hours per week as a contractor.  
  
  This opened up my eyes, and I looked for more clients. In this journey, I found more clients than I could handle, and ended up referring those clients to friends and having to say  no  a lot. 
  
  The people who told me consulting in Operation isn't possible had no idea. They hadn't tried it. They just went with what they'd heard.  
  
  Challenge yourself and others. Make up your own ideas. Try new things. You never know what's possible, but one thing is true: if you don't think it's possible, then that's certainly true for YOU.
