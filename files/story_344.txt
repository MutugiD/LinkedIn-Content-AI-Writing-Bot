Once I started consulting, the days of 3% raises were over. As I added more value (and got more confidence!) I charged more. 
  
  This is why setting your rate as a consultant is one of the most exciting exercises. You're no longer having someone tell you how much you're worth, and waiting on someone else to give you a raise or a promotion.  
  
  Further, with a salary at a company, your starting salary is your anchor for your lifetime at the company. Raises are usually percentage increases from that base, and your salary usually doesnâ€™t increase with the value you bring. You could bring in millions for your company, and only get $10k as a raise or bonus. 
  
  Once you become a freelancer, those days are over. As you acquire more experience, skills, and the ability to impact a company, you can charge as much as a client is willing to pay you. If you can offer 40% more, you can charge 40% more. No more waiting for someone to promote you or some arbitrary bonus. You charge what value you bring, period.
