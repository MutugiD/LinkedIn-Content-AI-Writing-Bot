Every day I see more super talented people get laid off. I can only imagine how challenging that is, especially for most who have never experienced this before. 
  
  Many have considered consulting on the side, and often don't because it’s scary, they don't know if they can do it, or they don't know how.  
  
  We're here to help. We have a community of folks learning to freelance, and talented freelancers who want to help. If access to this community will help you during this crazy time, or you want to help others, get (free) access → https://lnkd.in/dgYusU2  
  
  You might learn a thing or two and help someone else along the way.
