I didn't set out to build a course to help people launch their consulting businesses. I started Mylance and initially built a tax and bookkeeping service for independent consultants. I was struggling to find new customers, and during these user interviews I kept being asked how I had success consulting and how they could do it too. 
  
  Finally, in the middle of one of those conversations, I told a colleague I could help her launch her consulting business and would be with her every step of the way, if she gave me 7.5% of her revenue for the first 6 months. She agreed on the spot.  
  
  The thought to do this previously had not crossed my mind. But I saw and opportunity and decided to go for it. 
  
  Now I needed a course! So I designed a curriculum, wrote up content, and starting working with her.  
  
  In my next conversations with users, I told them about my journey as a consultant and they all wanted to do it too. So I enrolled them in the course.  
  
  And 24 months later, we have a cohort based, high NPS Accelerator that helps professionals launch and grow their consulting businesses. 
  
  You never know where one conversation will take you. The key is to have the conversations, keep an open mind, and move on opportunities when they're right in front of you!
