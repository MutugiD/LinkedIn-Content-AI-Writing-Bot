starting company hardest thing i've ever done. beginning felt like moving sludge hard see progress. many days feel like anything, would end refining cash flow model (for customers yet) felt productive. turns out, avoiding actually talking real customers, avoid potential rejected told idea sucks. started making plan night before. feel great, would accomplish one thing would move business forward. stuck it. matter bad day was, accomplished one thing. then, created list accomplishments. included incredibly small things like bought domain name talked 10 customers made first version website live. see things control, outcomes (like revenue targets). i'd go back list time feeling like making progress. many new entrepreneurs get stuck early phase, trying find idea pursue, spending time things matter (like making beautiful logo 20+ hours research market). best thing put one foot front other, accomplish one thing every day actually moves business forward, matter big small. #yourenotalone #founderlife #startups
