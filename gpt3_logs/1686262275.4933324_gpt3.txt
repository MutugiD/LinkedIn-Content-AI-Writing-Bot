PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years. The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, 
making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. I will through the provided narrative in story, master 
and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will hold myself to the highest literary standards, and  my writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.

RESPONSE:

It's a new year, and you have a choice to make: you can either work for a corporation or you can work for yourself. Both have their pros and cons, but it's entirely up to you.

If you decide to work for a corporation, you can expect to make a total annual compensation of around $180,000. You'll probably have to sit in 6 hours of meetings per day, and you can expect to work around 65 hours per week. However, your hourly rate will be around $56.

On the other hand, if you decide to work for yourself, you can expect to make a total annual compensation of around $310,000. You'll only have to sit in 1 hour of meetings per day, and you can expect to work around 30 hours per week. However, your hourly rate will be around $210.

The choice is yours, and it's entirely up to you.
