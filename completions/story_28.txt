If there’s one lesson that I’ve learnt in my career, it’s that taking risks and asking for what I want can get me far. Whether it was a half-cash, half-equity interning offer, leading Uber Eats in Europe or advising start-ups for a rev-share, I have been rewarded for my audacity. You have nothing to lose, except for the fears that hold you back. It is important to confront these with the help of a coach or therapist. If any of you have something you want to achieve, don’t be afraid to shout it out in the comments.
