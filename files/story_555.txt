At Uber, I was surrounded by talented people working extremely hard pushing towards the same goal. I added a lot of value, but as the company grew, the value I could impart to the company declined over time.  
  
  Instead of being 1 of 1,000 employees, I became one of 10,000 and eventually 1 of 20,000. 
  
  When I left Uber and started consulting for start-ups, everything changed. I saw first hand I could make an outsized impact on a smaller company. They didn't have the expertise, and my learnings from Uber enabled large, tangible impacts on these companies. 
  
  That feeling was incredibly empowering, I loved being the expert in the room, and it felt amazing to see what I could help these companies accomplish. 
  
  If you're feeling  stuck  at a company or feel that you're not making as big an impact as you could be, know that there are other options out there, where your experiences likely can make a step-change difference.
