Having experimented with different business models, in 2018 I stumbled upon a great opportunity- I took over an e-commerce store that sold a wine kit consisting of a combination of various products - wine opener, vacuum pump, foil opener and aerator. After automating the business and learning ways to market the product, I am now ready to part ways with this small business. You could benefit from this sale as it includes inventory worth $2000, fully automated online website, customer relationships, a fulfillment center, social media accounts, and more. If you're interested in exploring this opportunity, you can check out the business website and the Exchange Marketplace. For a limited time, you can use the promo code sample30 to get a nice 30% discount!
