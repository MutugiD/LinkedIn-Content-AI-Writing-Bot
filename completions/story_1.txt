Are you feeling like you don't have enough experience or don't know if you can consult in your area of expertise? We have been there. 

When the CEO of a seed company asked us how we had scaled Uber Eats in 5 different markets, we were ready to share our playbook and all the lessons we had learned along the way. We knew that by executing this playbook, they could raise their Series A. 

It was a great feeling to be appreciated and valued for our work. We no longer felt like we were undercharging or undervaluing our experience. We found flexible work, charged based on the value we provided, won monthly retainers, avoided politics, enjoyed the people we worked with, had free time and flexibility in our work life, and made more than we did in a full-time W2 job. 

Your experience is valuable. Don't let yourself be undervalued. 

Sincerely, 
Bradley and Mylance
