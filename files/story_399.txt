Don't tell a potential client your expertise lies in  Operations  or  Marketing  or  Product.  Frankly, that tells them nothing. 
  
  Put some work into figuring out how you tangibly add value to companies.  
  
  Operations folks: maybe you scale 2-sided B2B marketplaces through automation and optimizing operational processes? 
  
  Product folks: maybe you compile comprehensive customer research to generate a hypothesis, which you test until you have conviction, and build a product that multiplies growth by X times? 
  
  Marketing folks: do you A/B test landing page copy, buttons, and layouts to improve conversion by X%? 
  
  The exercise to outline your area of expertise and value add isn't particularly time consuming, and it can be the difference maker from getting a client and not.  
  
  Put the work in, put yourself out there, and see for yourself!
