first time negotiated consulting deal nervous idea doing. scared rejection, i'd ask number would get laughed room. it’s natural nervous asking money. likely haven’t done much life there’s always fears around “worth” rejection. think way - worst say “no.” fact, don’t get “no” point negotiation, something wrong. why? well, left money table! ever thought approach something hope hear no?
