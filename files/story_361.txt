I started Mylance out of a passion for flexible, fulfilling work. It's unfortunate so many are miserable in their jobs, and working hard to fulfill others' dreams. 
  
  Over the past 12 months, I've had the incredible opportunity to help hundreds improve their quality of life by working for themselves. 
  
  Today, we're taking the final step to close our Angel round that will help fuel us to the next level.  
  
  We have 95% of our fundraise completed from an impressive group of investors, including strategic Angels and Alumni Ventures Group, but after hearing demand from Mylanceâ€™s early customers!! we decided we had to find a way for them to join us on the journey of building this company.  
  
  So, I'm excited to announce we launched a Wefunder campaign to make sure they could join us for the ride, Accredited or not! And this gives you an opportunity to join us as well.  
  
  We have a very limited number of shares available given we've already hit our target, so don't hesitate if you do want to join.
