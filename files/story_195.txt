You're asked,  what's your rate? 
  
  You freeze. You could go a million directions. You want to close the deal, but you also want to get paid a lot. What do you do? 
  
  You have two options: 
  
  1. Be shy. Ask the client what they think your value is. Ask them what they've paid other consultants. Ask them to make an offer. 
  
  2. Go in with conviction. Tell them your rate, and tell them with confidence. 
  
  Why is #2 so important to get right? 
  
  Because you setting the terms and asking for your value demonstrates confidence. Bring conviction to your offer, know your value, and ask for it.  
  
  If you get a  no,  that's a good thing. You asked for high enough, and you can let them counter.  
  
  If you get a  yes,  you got what you wanted and know you can ask for more next time. 
  
  Go in asking for your value with conviction. That internal confidence will take you a long way.
