PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

Behind every successful consulting project is a compelling proposal that legitimizes you, showcases your value, and clearly outlines how you'll help the client.  
  
  How do you put this in writing? 
  
  Your proposal should be a one-pager with 4 sections:  
  
  1 . About you: your experience, accomplishments, and education  
  
  2. Top priorities for the company (you will find this out on your intro call)  
  
  3. Initial projects to execute for the company (based on their priorities - you will find this out on your intro call)  
  
  4. Logistics (compensation, travel, on-site time, etc.)  
  
  Anything you'd add?
