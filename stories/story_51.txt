Why is it so hard to make any kind of change? 
  
  Whether it's losing weight, quitting your job, reading 20 minutes a day instead of zero, starting a business, or breaking up with your phone, it's always easier said than done. 
  
  We're good at talking: saying we're going to do it and maybe even planning out HOW we'll do it. 
  
  But when it comes down to it, we struggle and often give up.  
  
  This is because we focus on outcomes, instead of the process.  
  
  We see a goal. We want to achieve that goal. But we don't put in place routines, process, or accountability to actually make it happen. 
  
  This is what I see happen with so many people who want to start their fractional consulting business.  
  
  They no doubt want to. Many even see the path to doing so. But they never get off the ground.  
  
  Be honest with your fears. Take the time to get the clarity you need. And then when you're ready, focus on consistent, needle-moving activities to land that first client and grow your business.
