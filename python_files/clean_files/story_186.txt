“growth happens slowly once” it’s cliche it’s true. it’s true consulting business too. there’s pre-work required successful long term. need come great offer, nail ideal client, set rates, begin lead generation process. it’s unlikely yield immediate results. efforts compound. sustain efforts stay positive early days, even little positive results, positives results right around corner. goal something like $20k / month, that’s two clients $10k per month each, tons customers getting. growth right around corner - need stick keep working hard smart. got this.
