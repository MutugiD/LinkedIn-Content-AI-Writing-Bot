Is it harder to get a consulting gig now than it was a year or two ago? 
  
  I get this question A LOT from our community. 
  
  And the short answer is, yes. It's harder. Fewer companies are hiring and more experts want to consult.  
  
  But, it's far from impossible. I know thousands of consultants that are not only crushing it, but they're also turning down work because they are in such high demand. 
  
  What makes them successful? 
  
  1. A very clear niche and value-add 
  2. Strong network 
  3. Continuing to build that network through weekly calls and meet-ups 
  4. Delivering high-value client work that leads to referrals 
  
  It's harder than it was, but it's far from impossible. 
  
  Anyone that says it's impossible is making excuses for their lack of success.  
  
  It's harsh but true. 
  
  If you want it, it's out there. You just need to go get it.
