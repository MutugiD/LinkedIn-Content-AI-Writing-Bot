Imposter syndrome is real. Nearly everyone I talk to, including myself, no matter how accomplished, has it. 
  
  I had to ask for nearly everything in my career. I asked if I could go launch Uber Eats in Miami with no Eats experience, but Uber let me. 
  
  After, I applied for the Uber Eats GM role in Madrid (even though I didn't speak fluent Spanish) so I could get the RGM on the phone. It worked: I ended up helping with the Madrid launch, and I launched Milan. 
  
  Then I inquired about Uber Freight and through networking within Uber, I was able to move over and launch Uber Freight alongside a talented team. 
  
  After I left Uber, I wondered if I could work part-time. After many rejections, I found a client who let me work 20 hours a week for $250/hr. 
  
  The whole time I wondered if I could do this and if I deserved it. It was always there, and it still is to some degree. 
  
  I'm now a founder and that brings along a whole new set of doubts. Can I do this? Don't most start-ups fail? Will I fail? 
  
  When all is said and done, I believe in myself. I write down the doubts I have. I write down my accomplishments. I write down where I'm strong and where I have areas to improve. Each day I keep pushing forward, asking for what I want.  Fake it till you make it,  right? 
  
  How do you deal with it?
