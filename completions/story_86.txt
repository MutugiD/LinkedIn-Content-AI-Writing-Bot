As someone with years of professional experience, courses, coaching, and feedback, it's time to monetize that experience and aesthetic to hit the $10k mark. To do this successfully, it's essential to stand out from the competition. Describe yourself in a unique way and make sure you can explain the value your experience offers. Get on calls with potential clients, and don't pitch yourself until after you've asked thoughtful questions. It's by understanding a client's challenges and pain points that you can validate your experience and uncover opportunities for yourself. Once there's an opportunity, craft a detailed proposal in 24 hours. This needs to cover your experience and badassery, company goals, the value you'll offer, and any logistical details around travel and compensation. With confident execution of the above, success is guaranteed.
