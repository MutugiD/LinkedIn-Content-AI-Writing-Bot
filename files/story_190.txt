There's one recurring investment I've been making over the last 5 years that's consistently paid off no matter how much I put into it: 
  
  myself. 
  
  I've done therapy and coaching, taken risks on buying and starting businesses.  
  
  I spent $16,000 on a coach. That amount is no small investment. But it changed my life forever and continues to impact the way I live my personal and professional life.  
  
  It's the one thing that compounds infinitely and I know I'll never regret. 
  
  It's not easy to make a change. To grow. To accomplish your lofty goals. 
  
  I knew I'd have a higher likelihood of success and a faster outcome if I invested in help and learnings. 
  
  So I did. And I'll never regret it.
