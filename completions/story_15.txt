It all started with the question: What do I want to do with my professional life? When I left Uber, I wanted to explore that question while still making money and adding value. I began freelancing with different start-ups and realized I could make great money doing this while still exploring the answers to my question. This led to me to start my own start-up known as Mylance. Becoming a freelancer allowed me to explore different ideas, as well as provided me time away from traditional work. Freelancing gives you the opportunity for higher paying projects, better use of your time, time and space to pursue passions, and the ability to fund your next company. #passioneconomy #freelance #startups #mylance
