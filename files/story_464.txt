I know this is a tough time for many. Companies are laying off people, great people, with the drop in business. 
  
  While getting laid off is shocking and awful, it creates an opportunity for something new, and in retrospect, it might be the best thing to happen to someone. 
  
  Over the past few months, I've dedicated my time to starting and building up Mylance, aimed to empower freelancers by removing the administrative burden of starting your own freelance business. 
  
  If you or anyone you know is passionate about this as well, shoot me a note - I'm looking for a partner that shares this passion with me, and wants to build a great business that empowers the already 57 million freelancers in the US, and paves the way for many more. 
  
  Please give this post a like to spread the word, and reach out to me if you or anyone you know might be interested in partnering up!
