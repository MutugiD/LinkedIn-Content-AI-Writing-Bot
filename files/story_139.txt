When I quit my job and went out on my own, one of the hardest parts was very much unexpected. 
  
  I had a complete lack of structure. 
  
  I was used to getting up at a certain time, going to an office, needing to be in meetings, and having deadlines. 
  
  All of a sudden, that entire structure was gone. 
  
  And because I was working ~25 hours per week, I didn't need to be up at a certain time. If I wanted to sleep until noon and work from 1-4pm, I could. 
  
  And I did that a few times. It was fun. Until it wasn't. 
  
  I felt terrible.  
  
  I'm an ambitious person that wants to be pushing the ball forward, working on cool things and furthering my knowledge, experience, and value-add. 
  
  So, I put in my own structure. 
  
  I started a morning routine. I set my alarm for the same time every day. I'd work out in the morning. I'd journal and meditate. 
  
  I'd work for my consulting clients from 10am - 2pm each day with a break for lunch. I set meetings with myself the night before for important items to accomplish. 
  
  Then after 2pm I'd do one of the following: 
  
  1. Work on a passion project. I had a lot of start-up ideas and was validating them during this time 
  
  2. Enjoy one of my hobbies. I like to golf, play tennis, and hike to name a few. I enjoyed some down time. 
  
  If you're in a transition phase right now, consider it an incredible opportunity. It's a time to step back and reflect, and focus on yourself. 
  
  Be intentional with your time. Create structure in your day that helps you accomplish what you need to while still giving you free time to explore. 
  
  For those who have put in place your own structure, what's one tip you can share with me that has helped you?
