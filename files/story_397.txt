The Mylance Consulting Bootcamp is back starting January 11th! We help talented professionals launch and scale up their independent consulting businesses. 
  
  If you've thought about consulting for yourself but haven't because: 
  
  1. You don't know how to present yourself or your  niche 
  2. You have imposter syndrome 
  3. You don't know how to get started 
  4. You have your first few clients but aren't confident in your rate, project design, or project scope 
  
  our Bootcamp might be the perfect place for you. In it we provide:  
  
  1. The tools youâ€™ll actually use in your business: your niche, written proposal, rate, optimal business set-up 
  
  2. The knowledge: negotiation techniques, where to find clients, handle client push-back, and close the deal 
  
  3. Templates and examples of proposals, negotiation techniques, and contracts, that have all worked in the past across dozens of clients and hundreds of thousands in revenue 
  
  4. Access to experts, CPAs, lawyers, and other experienced consultants to get your questions answered 
  
  Shoot me a note or apply on the Mylance website if this sounds like you. We have a limited number of spots for our January Bootcamp left!
