When I left tech, I knew I wanted to start a company, but I didn't know what, and I wasn't sure if I was ready to fully dive in yet.  
  
  As I explored opportunities, I wondered if I could work for myself as a consultant. I had heard of other people doing it, and what did I have to lose by trying? 
  
  I messaged 12 different people on LinkedIn offering to help their businesses as a part-time consultant. These were either people that had reached out to me on LinkedIn for a role, or folks in my network. 
  
  11 of them either ignored me or said no. One responded with interest, and we jumped on a call. 
  
  That one ended up being my first consulting client, which I contracted for over the next 9 months. It also gave me the confidence to find more clients, and turn this whole consulting trial into a real way of life, that eventually led me to start Mylance. 
  
  You never know where  what do I have to lose by trying  will take you. You'll probably get told  no  a few times, but the one time you get a  yes  might change your life. It did for me.
