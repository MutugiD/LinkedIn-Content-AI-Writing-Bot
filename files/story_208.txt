I'd think the most successful Shark Tank product is something elaborate, fancy, and innovative. 
  
  Something nobody has thought about before. An invention. 
  
  It's not. It's a sponge. 
  
  When I was at my partner's house doing the dishes the other day, I commented on her sponge. She told me she LOVES IT and proceeded to tell me all the great things it does. She sounded like an infomercial for it! 
  
  Turns out, it was that sponge.  
  
  Scrub Daddy has done over $225 million in sales since Shark Tank.  
  
  That's right. A sponge. 
  
  Your product doesn't need to be inventive, elaborate, or fancy. 
  
  It just has to be better than the competition. And solve the problem so well that your customers rave about it, and are more than happy to pay for it.
