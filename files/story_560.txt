All this  workcation  talk brings me back to the early Uber days.  
  
  When hundreds of Uber employees would submit a  proposal  for a new product feature or process, and then  get the opportunity  to spend our Christmas / New Years working on it at a remote location (some of which was paid for by the company). 
  
  Uber would let anyone submit ideas, pick the top 100, and those  winners  would build out a small team to work on the idea for 7-10 days. 
  
  The teams would compete to build it as much as possible in that short time frame, and the top ideas would be presented to the entire company, with the best ones actually being built into the app. 
  
  I felt such loyalty to Uber in those years, and hundreds of employees spent their holiday time working on a new product or feature to move the company forward.  
  
  Some will say this was a toxic environment. That Uber made up such a huge part of our lives and we gave  too much  to the company. 
  
  But I don't feel that way. Nobody was forced to go on workation. I went because I wanted to. It was an incredible experience to work with really talented people on a life-changing product. 
  
  These days, that kind of experience at a company seems hard to find. And it's of course not perfect - nothing is.  
  
  Just remember that everything you do is a choice. Your choice. Nobody can force you to do anything. And the sooner we take ownership and accountability, the faster we can make a change, and choose to be in a situation that makes us happy.
