How I transitioned from consulting for myself to starting the Mylance Bootcamp â†’  
  
  After 2 years of successful consulting, I would post on LinkedIn about some of my learnings. This yielded friends and former colleagues reaching out to me asking about my consulting. Through these conversations, I realized I had learned a lot and built up a real expertise in finding clients and closing 5-figure consulting deals. 
  
  So in the middle of one of the conversations, I told a former Uber colleague I could help her with her business every step of the way in exchange for a cut of the revenue I would help her make.  
  
  She immediately agreed! I had a customer! But no product. Whoops. Now I had to build out the content. So I got to work and started building out the steps she'd need to take to find her first client. 
  
  Over my subsequent conversations with other colleagues, I told them I had a course, and people immediately were excited and many enrolled. All of a sudden I had a course and paying customers. 
  
  One of my biggest learnings early on was engagement was low if my customers went through the course on their own. They needed a cohort, they needed deadlines, and they wanted to be held accountable. 
  
  Fast forward 24 months, we have helped hundreds of professionals launch and grow their independent consulting businesses, and have evolved into a full tech business with software and tax subscriptions to remove the admin burden. 
  
  Amazing things can happen when you just DO things and capitalize when opportunities come your way.
