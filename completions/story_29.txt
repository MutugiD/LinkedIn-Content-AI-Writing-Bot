I had only recently quit Uber and was unsure of what to do next. After going through the daunting task of responding to recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn, I finally got one positive response from a company that was willing to get on a call with me. 

I created a deck that showcased my skills and understanding of their challenges and proposed an arrangement for advisory services, which the company found appealing. After responding to their counteroffer of $250 per hour, I found myself with my first consulting client. At 25 hours a week, I was now making $25k/month! It was a moment that changed my life and trajectory forever.
