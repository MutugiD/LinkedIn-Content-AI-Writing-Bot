The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted.
