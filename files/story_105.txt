I got told “no” by 150 investors when I first went to raise money.  
  
  I used an underrated tactic to stay positive: 
  
  I’d never gotten rejected more in my life than when I went to go raise money. Everyone in my network told me it would be easy.  
  
  Well, it wasn’t. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. 
  
  But I had to stay positive. I had to keep grinding.  
  
  And more importantly, I had to go into the next conversation confident and excited, believing they’d say “yes.”  
  
  After 100 “no’s” it’s very hard to be confident going into your 101st investor pitch. 
  
  But it wasn’t the first thing that was tough as I built my company. It was tough from the beginning.  
  
  Customers saying “no.” Tough feedback on our initial products. Lack of motivation. Criticism all over the place. 
  
  So, I started a list of accomplishments. And I put EVERYTHING on the list. 
  
  “I bought a domain.” 
  “I chose a name.” 
  “I made my first dollar.” 
  “First $100 of revenue.” 
  “Hired a lawer.” 
  
  The list might have been 100 items long 6 months into the company’s lifespan. 
  
  And every time I got down, I’d revisit it.  
  
  It was a reminder of how far I’d come from the beginning. From when Mylance was just an exciting idea. 
  
  And it’s how I got through those investor rejections. 
  
  I ended up getting 15 yes’s and 154 “no’s.” The 15 yes’s filled out our Angel round, and funded our next stage of development. 
  
  And I learned a ton for how to do it better next time. 
  
  I keep adding to the list. Every step of the way. Because building a company is all flavors of “difficult” and when I’m down the most, is when I need that list
