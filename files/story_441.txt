People ask me all the time how I found my first freelance client.  
  
  I had decided it was something I wanted to try, and went back through 12 Linkedin outreaches and responded to them. 11 either didn't respond or told me  no.  One said,  interesting, send us a proposal. 
  
  I didn't know how to send a proposal, or set my rate, or scope out an engagement. I did my best, took their feedback, and got my first client. 
  
  I eventually started Mylance so you can take everything I learned, and launch your own freelance business.  
  
  Accomplishing something new starts with believing you can do it, and trying it. 
  
  You might get rejected. You might get told  no.  In fact, you almost definitely will in one way or another. 
  
  If you truly believe in yourself, you'll push past that  no  and you'll make a positive change in your life. The only one holding you back is you.
