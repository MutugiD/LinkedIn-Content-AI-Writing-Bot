Often I hear about a colleague having a consulting gig fall in their lap. It's a past manager, a friend, or someone they used to work with.  
  
  And all of a sudden they're making money part-time, on the side, adding value to that company, and loving it. 
  
  But now they're running a small business. Do they need an LLC? What should their rate be? How do they hone their niche for future clients? 
  
  Coming from Operations at Uber, I worked hard over my first 9 months consulting to hone my niche, determine my rate, get my LLC to the right spot before I really felt comfortable closing clients. And then, it became like second nature.  
  
  I now use those experiences to help others get to that point. Where finding and closing clients is second nature.  
  
  Are you in that spot right now? Are you thinking about freelance consulting but not sure what your rate should be or how to define your niche?
