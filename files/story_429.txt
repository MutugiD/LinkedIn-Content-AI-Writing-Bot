Nobody ever said closing freelance clients was easy! 
  
  Braden Weinstock is one of our experienced, incredibly talented coaches that help our bootcamp customers get their freelance businesses off the ground. 
  
  He leads a session where he simulates a potential client, and our customers work through the company's challenges to scope out a freelance project. The simulation is not an easy one, and our customers are encouraged to  fail  with us, so they can succeed in the real world.  
  
  Excited to kick off another cohort Aug 10th :)
