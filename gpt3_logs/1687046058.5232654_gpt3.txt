PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

The honest truth: the starting salary at your new company is your anchor for your lifetime at the company. 
  
  When you're hired as an FTE at a company you negotiate a starting salary.  
  
  You don’t know if you’re being paid well or not.  
  
  And raises are usually percentage increases from that base. Further, your salary doesn’t increase with the value you bring. You could bring in millions for your company, and only get $25,000 as a raise or bonus. 
  
  Once you become a freelance consultant, those days are over.  
  
  As you acquire more experience, skills, and the ability to impact a company, you can charge as much as a client is willing to pay you. 
  
   If you can offer 40% more, you can charge 40% more. No more waiting for someone to promote you or some arbitrary bonus.  
  
  **You charge for the value you bring, period.** 
  
  That is, if you ask for it.

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story. 

SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

As an employee, it can be hard to predict how much you will earn. With freelance consulting, however, you can charge for the value you bring, as much as a client is willing to pay. As you acquire more experience, skills and become a better consultant, you can increase your rates – no promotions or arbitrary bonuses needed.
