Unpopular opinion: why don't more people start as consultants to companies? 
  
  Joining a company full-time is one of the biggest decisions you make in your life. You probably only make it a few times, and joining the wrong company (mission, culture, compensation, your value, etc.) is a huge mistake for both you and the company. 
  
  By contracting at a company first for a few months, you both get to know each other, try it out, and determine if it's a good fit. If it is a fit, you'll likely get a much better offer, be placed in the ideal spot (for you and the company), and have a longer tenure there.
