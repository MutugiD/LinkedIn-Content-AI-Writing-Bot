After I got my first client from LinkedIn, I wanted another client. But I didn't know how. And I had ALL my financial eggs with one consulting contract. That didnâ€™t seem safe. And I wanted another.  
  
  So, I did some thinking about the best way to get another consulting gig, and ended up trying a few different methods: 
  
  1. I signed up for a consulting marketplace that matched my niche 
  
  2. I did outreach a few times per week to people at companies who I thought I could help 
  
  3. I continued to have calls with former colleagues to see what they were working on 
  
  4. I started posting on LinkedIn about my learnings as a consultant and at Uber 
  
  5. I teamed up with a former Uber friend who was an expert in Sales and Marketing 
  
  And believe it or not, over the next 2 years, every single one of those methods would bring in a high-priced consulting client. 
  
  There's no one right way to do things. The key is getting started, finding support, and holding yourself accountable.
