i'm saying lot days. hard. want say people asking help. also know need prioritize incredibly well want business success long term. unfortunately, requires eliminating many distractions possible focusing entirely customers, team, market. hurts lot. feel good. wish could jump calls students talk entrepreneurs asking help. know every minute spent someone else, minute spent work. i'm going prioritize myself, will? think balance helping others focusing work?
