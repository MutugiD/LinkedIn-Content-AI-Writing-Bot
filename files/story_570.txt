8 years ago today, I walked into the Uber office. It was my first day. I was excited but nervous - didn't know what to expect. The nerves didn't last long - I was immediately confronted by my boss who was underwater with driver emails, driver payments, and a whole host of other fire drills.  
  
  I had left my cushy, well-paying consulting job to join this fast-paced start-up few people had heard of because I thought I'd learn a lot and it seemed like a cool product. 
  
  Fast forward 4 years: I got to manage 9 markets in the North Carolinas, launch Uber Eats in Miami and Milan, and launch and scale Uber Freight in the US. 
  
  Most importantly, I learned what I was capable of. I learned I had what it took to launch a business unit and run an Ops team. I learned I had a ton of grit and resolve to work through some incredibly difficult situations. And I learned I could hang with the best of them (them being my talented peers at Uber). 
  
  I'm so thankful for my time there, and thankful to past Bradley, who saw an opportunity, didn't know what it was really going to entail, but took a leap of faith anyways and put everything I had into it. 
  
  As big of a leap as it was for me to join Uber, it might've been an even bigger leap to quit 4 years later, start my own consulting business, and eventually found Mylance.  
  
  Rarely does a leap of faith not work on when you're all-in, and time after time I'm reminded of that. 
  
  Is there a leap you're considering taking but hesitant to right now? What's holding you back?
