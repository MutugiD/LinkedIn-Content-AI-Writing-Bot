If 2020 has taught us anything, it's that the world is uncertain and nothing is guaranteed.  
  
  Consulting for myself enabled me to embrace that uncertainty, and work across a number of clients, so if one company got into tough shape and had to end the relationship, I always had 2-3 behind it to supplement my income. 
  
  I loved consulting for the freedom, flexibility, and fulfillment. Further, it was incredibly empowering to be the expert in the room helping the next generation of start-ups succeed and learn from my experiences.
