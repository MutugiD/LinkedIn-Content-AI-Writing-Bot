One key to a $20,000 project vs a $5,000 one: a super narrow consulting niche. 
  
  You might be thinking that you’re a jack of all trades or a generalist. Maybe you are. That's great. You're well-rounded.  
  
  But I'm going to ask you to put that aside for a second.  
  
  Because a company needs specific talent to solve specific problems.  
  
  And companies pay great money to solve specific, pressing problems.  
  
  Companies don’t hire generalists to solve specific problems. 
  
  
  Do you have trouble narrowing down your niche?
