I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

I've worked hard over the years to optimize my LinkedIn profile to get customers and inbound consulting leads.  
  
  Here are the 4 top things I've done to it: 
  
  1. My headline shares how I add value. From two seconds looking at my profile, I try to stand out. For you as a consultant, you’re an expert in a field. You’re not a job title. Your header is the first thing a profile visitor reads. So, it’s crucial that it stands out. 
  
  2. My bio legitimizes me. My bio provides additional context on my niche through my professional accomplishments, and legitimizes me to my audience. I also use it to humanize me by sharing some interests outside of work. People want to work with interesting humans. Share some of your hobbies. 
  
  3. I have contact links easily accessible so people can get in touch with me or sign-up. Let's face it: your LinkedIn doesn’t do a great job of sharing your portfolio, case studies, testimonials, or your brand. Thus, you want a separate website or landing page to direct them to, and they’re also likely to contact you there.  
  
  4. My job titles are supported my accomplishments in those jobs. They don't share what the company does (companies have big enough marketing budgets!) and they're certainly not blank. 
  
  I detail out these points with examples and suggestions for how you can do this too, and we're sharing it in tomorrow's Mylance newsletter.

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story.
