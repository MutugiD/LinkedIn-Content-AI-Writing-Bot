To close a consulting client, you need a kick-ass proposal. Something that hits home with the client and makes it incredibly easy to hire you. 
  
  I start every proposal with the same header. The content might surprise you. 
  
  I start it with a reminder of who I am and what I’ve done.  
  
  It’s a reminder of why I’m the best person for this project. 
  
  Why?  
  
  Your client has a million things going on. This is a quick reminder to say “Hey, remember me? I’m awesome.”  
  
  Most don’t do this. So when you do it, you'll stand out. 
  
  If you want to see the rest of this proposal that won me a $20k project, comment “proposal” here and I’ll send it over to you.
