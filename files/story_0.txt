You're leaving money on the table.  
  
  You've worked for it. Now you need to capitalize on it. Here's how I did: 
  
  I was part of the early team at Uber Freight. One of the differences in the product we built was a  book it now  price that required no human touch or negotiation. The pro of this was efficiency and transparency: the price you saw is what you got. 
  
  After I left Uber Freight, I got in touch with a smaller Freight brokerage who had trouble growing in the heavy haul space. After asking a bunch of questions, we agreed to a consulting gig at $17k / month to help them juice their growth. 
  
  After looking at their business, it seemed they were losing money through a cumbersome booking process, and I helped them streamline it with transparency and automation that I had learned from Uber. 
  
  You have amazing knowledge from your experiences. It feels like common sense to you. That common sense is gold to the right person in the right situation. 
  
  Stop leaving money on the table, stop working for free, and monetize that knowledge.
