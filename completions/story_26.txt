I was hesitant to jump into a full-time role after leaving Uber, so I looked for part-time consulting work. I was able to land a consulting client and worked nearly nine months, earning more than my salary at Uber in only two years. My story is proof that an independent, freelance career is possible; and if you're coming from Uber and want to try this lifestyle, I'm here to help. #uber #independentconsulting #freelance #flexibility #freedom #earnyourtruevalue #beyourownboss
