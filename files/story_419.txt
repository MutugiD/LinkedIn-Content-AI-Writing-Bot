I don't feel like myself these last few days. I'm not as productive, I'm not as sharp, and sometimes I struggle to feel motivated. 
  
  Generally, I'm pretty tough on myself. I have incredibly high expectations for myself and for my business, and that can lead to a tough combination when I'm not being my best self. 
  
  Lately, I've been trying to cut myself some slack. There are so many tough things going on in the world today, and they take an unquantifiable toll on us.  
  
  How do you go about staying emotionally healthy and strong during these times? What do you do for self care?  
  
  I'd love to learn from the Linkedin community and share in these challenges together!
