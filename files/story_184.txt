I wanted a personal website when I was consulting. But I didn't have one because I'm a horrible designer and it seemed like a hassle. 
  
  But, I should've had one. 
  
  I should've had a place to showcase my consulting niche, have testimonials, and build out case studies showcasing my experience. 
  
  So, I went out and built one. And I built it for you too. You're not going to design it exactly how you want. There's no drag and drop or design abilities. We got it professionally designed for you. And it pulls in your LinkedIn experience so you don't have to start from scratch. 
  
  And the best part: we made it 100% for free. Forever. So it's yours. All you have to do is answer a few questions about your professional experience.
