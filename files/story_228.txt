Can you get equity as a consultant to a start-up? 
  
  Short answer: yes. Here's what to consider: 
  
  1. Make sure if / when you leave, you have plenty of time to exercise your options (I got 10 years with one client) 
  
  2. They can’t actually issue shares until their board meets. You can ask when this is happening next, and make sure it’s before the raise / new 409a because it will affect your options strike price, and this could be a significant change. 
  
  3. How do I value equity? The start-up wants to quantify share value based on the preferred price (what investors are paying), and we know that’s not an accurate price. Further, which preferred price (they’ll want the upcoming raise, and you’ll want the previous raise). In my experience, these are all things you have to negotiate. And again, every start-up needs you way more than you need them, so if you don’t get a deal you’re okay with, it’s better to walk away. 
  
  4. Get your options / shares on Carta if they’re not already so you can see your shares transparently 
  
  5. To the extent possible, use the company’s lawyers. Using your own lawyer is expensive. If you have a quick question, Mylance has lawyers that can answer a quick question in our Legal topic. 
  
  6. How do I figure out a cash / equity split I’m okay with? 
  This entirely depends what you’re optimizing for. For me, I was optimizing for cash, and wanted to build out a small “portfolio” of equity in some start-ups, so I would go for 80% cash so I could support my life, and then still get some equity. If cash isn’t an issue, it makes sense to optimize for equity, especially where you really believe in the leadership team and mission of the company.
