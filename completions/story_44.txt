With years of experience helping fractional execs, I have mastered a three-step process for helping them articulate their value prop: focusing on professional accomplishments, identifying unique skills and talents, and combining the two into an effective niche. Having heads up the launch of Miami FL's marketplace, I am uniquely positioned to help others in similar endeavors, leveraging my expertise in B2C, B2B, and two and three-sided marketplaces to help companies scale their operations.
