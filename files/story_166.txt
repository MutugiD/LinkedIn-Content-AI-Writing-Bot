5 habits that have helped me drive my business forward since I left corporate in 2018: 
  
  1. Planning the night before. I am clear what needs to be done the day before. But not the day off. Planning my action items the night before has increased my productivity more than any other  hack 
  
  2. Take that networking call. I don't enjoy networking. But I take more one-off calls than I ever used to. Some are productive, some are not, but the outcomes from the productive ones far outweigh the ones that led nowhere 
  
  3. Write about my experience. Most don't want to do this. My LinkedIn posts over the years have led to many opportunities and new customers, not to mention it has built a trusted relationship with my online community 
  
  4. Structure my day in a way that works for me. I need to have heads down work time in the mornings. So all my meetings are in the afternoon. This works for me. Find what works for you. 
  
  5. Turned off Slack and email notifications. I check them when I'm available and ready to check them. I want to be proactive about when I'm ready to respond, not reactive to every notification that comes in. 
  
  These 5 habits have made a huge difference in my productivity and grow my business.
