I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

Our May Accelerator cohort kicked off yesterday with 4 AWESOME participants, who are all excited to launch and grow their independent consulting businesses. 
  
  The first day of the cohort is such an energizing one for me and our customers: we go through their niche and ideal client, which really starts to formalize the reality of this for them. 
  
  Most of them are looking to utilize 15-20 hours of extra time in their week to work part-time, make great money, and enjoy adding value to interesting clients. 
  
  One key thing we cover in the session is how important it is to have a niche that's a 1-2 sentence, impactful way to communicate what I do, and how I add value to your company. 
  
  It's MUCH easier said than done, and it's one of the biggest areas we help customers. 
  
  It's the difference from saying:  
  
  Hi I'm Bradley. I worked in Operations and Launch at Uber and now I'm consulting for companies to help them grow and scale   
  
  to 
  
  Hi I'm Bradley. I specialize in launching and scaling 3-sided B2C marketplaces for early stage, post product market fit companies given my experience launching Uber Eats in Miami and Milan. 
  
  You know EXACTLY what I do and how I help you. And further, I'm validated given my past experience! And that's the goal with that one sentence. 
  
  If you were asked to explain your value add in one sentence, could you do it?

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story.
