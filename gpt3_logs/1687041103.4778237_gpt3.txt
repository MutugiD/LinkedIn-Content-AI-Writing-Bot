PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

Often I hear about a colleague having a consulting gig fall in their lap. It's a past manager, a friend, or someone they used to work with.  
  
  And all of a sudden they're making money part-time, on the side, adding value to that company, and loving it. 
  
  But now they're running a small business. Do they need an LLC? What should their rate be? How do they hone their niche for future clients? 
  
  Coming from Operations at Uber, I worked hard over my first 9 months consulting to hone my niche, determine my rate, get my LLC to the right spot before I really felt comfortable closing clients. And then, it became like second nature.  
  
  I now use those experiences to help others get to that point. Where finding and closing clients is second nature.  
  
  Are you in that spot right now? Are you thinking about freelance consulting but not sure what your rate should be or how to define your niche?

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story.

RESPONSE:

Are you on the cusp of starting a freelance consulting business but unsure of how to go about it? I can relate as I was in that same situation not too long ago. I worked for nine months to define my niche, determine my rate, and establish an LLC. Now, I help others do the same so that they can be successful in their freelance consulting journey.
