I talk a lot about the money I made as a consultant. 
  
  But much more importantly, it gave me the freedom and flexibility I was looking for. 
  
  I had left Uber. I was incredibly burnt out, and I needed a break. 
  
  But I also needed to make money and I was curious how my expertise would be valued by other start-ups.  
  
  As I found clients, I made sure to limit my scope and work hours to 25 hours per week. I didn't join my clients' Slack channels and I set clear boundaries when I could be reached (hint: not after 5pm). 
  
  This allowed me to pursue other endeavors (which, frankly, was the real reason I'd quit my job). 
  
  I tested start-up ideas. I started a blog. I bought (and sold) an e-commerce company. And I had free time. I explored San Francisco. I spent time with my new puppy and invested in my relationship. I got to take a half-step back from the crazy 4 years busting my butt at Uber.  
  
  And now I could work on my own terms. With whom and when I wanted.  
  
  I made great money, but most importantly, I got the freedom and flexibility I needed to make a great decision for what I'd dive into next.
