Do I need a website for my consulting business?  
  
  Is it 100% mandatory? No. But you do want one. Here's why.  
  
  Clients want to check out who you are, your experiences, and your specific skills to see if they should talk to you or hire you.  
  
  And let's face it, LinkedIn doesn't get the job done. Everyone has a LinkedIn, it doesn't set you apart, and, more importantly, it doesn't showcase the specific consulting value you can add to a company.  
  
  It showcases your experiences, which are helpful, but what makes you uniquely you?  
  
  To make a great website for your consulting business, it needs to have some crucial aspects to portray yourself as a professional and make a potential client want to work with you. 
  
  
  1. How you uniquely add value to businesses 
  2. Your past experiences (validation) 
  3. Your bio - what makes you interesting? 
  4. Sample projects or case studies 
  5. Expert opinions or content (optional) 
  6. Testimonials 
  7. Way to get in touch with you 
  8. Professional look and feel
