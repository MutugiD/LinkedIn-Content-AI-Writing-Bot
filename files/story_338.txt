The constant stream of articles, fundraising announcements, and new product launches can really wear on me as a founder. It feels like every company in the entire planet is an overnight success with millions in the bank, 40% MoM growth and a new products coming out every other Tuesday.  
  
  In reality, this couldn't be further from the truth. Starting a company is incredibly difficult, many don't ever even start because of how hard it is, and very few actually get off the ground.  
  
  It doesn't matter where you are in your journey - know that its your journey, it doesn't matter what anyone else is doing, and you're your own measure of success.
