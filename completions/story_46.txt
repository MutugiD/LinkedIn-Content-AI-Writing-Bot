For 15 years, I had dreamed of starting a business. The reality was no matter how excited I got about an idea, I would hit a roadblock, get bored, or discouraged, so I would eventually stop. In 2019, I made a commitment to myself to no longer quit- this time, I was all in. I took a risk on a problem and customer I truly cared about, investing time, energy, and grit, and I kept going no matter how hard it was. Now, I'm proud to say that I followed through on my dream. There's no right time or right idea to start a business, but it will take a lot of hard work and hustle to succeed.
