Getting inbounds for your consulting business is WAY better than doing outreach. 
  
  Once I started letting my network know via LinkedIn that I was consulting independently, I got a few folks from my past (some from YEARS ago) reaching out asking if I could help them. You never know who will come back to offer you a $20k project! 
  
  Your network needs to know what you're up to so when there is an opportunity, you can be top of mind.  
  
  To do this well, update your Linkedin with your accomplishments and your offering.  
  
  Once you've done that, post some thoughts on your area of expertise in a LinkedIn post. Do this frequently (every day if you're up for it!) youâ€™ll be shocked at how many views you get. Some of these views turn into messages and some turn into potential clients.  
  
  Besides 30 minutes of your time, what do you have to lose? This isn't a note on LinkedIn that says HEY I'M CONSULTING LOOK AT ME!  
  
  This is a message sharing your point of view on a topic where you're an expert. While what you know seems common sense to you, it's not to others, and you might get an incredibly positive response. If you don't, no harm no foul, you can either try again or try another method. 
  
  This isn't self-promotion. You're just sharing your learnings. 
  
  Most people reading this don't want to do this and won't do it. So it's an incredible opportunity to set yourself apart, and get inbound consulting leads coming to find YOU.  
  
  After all, why do you think I post on LinkedIn?
