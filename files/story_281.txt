Our customers are constantly challenging the status quo, going out on their own, and leaving the stability and comfort of a full-time job. 
  
  We ask them what they're looking to get out of launching their own consulting businesses. Here are some responses: 
  
  Earn $15,000 per month as a consultant 
  
  Create a niche, repeatable consulting service that I can ultimately operationalize as software 
  
  Learn the tools to launch a consulting business, work as a consultant part-time and build a new network with new connections within the Mylance community. 
  
  Earn $20K per month working 10-20 hours per week 
  
  Be prepared to consistently find consulting gigs that can enable me to make an extra $5k per month. 
  
  Everyone has a different benchmark for success. These numbers might look crazy to some, but they're not. They're real. And they're possible. 
  
  To win big, you have to dream big.  
  
  What's a dream you have that's been in the  back of your mind  but you haven't done anything with yet?
