Love making $500 / hr with expert networks? 
  
  Same. But it's inconsistent. I never know when my next call will come in. 
  
  You could take that knowledge and be making $10k / month on retainer with the right clients instead.  
  
  Here’s how: 
  
  If you’re already making money from the expert networks, it’s clear that you have an area of expertise that is in demand. So if you’re worrying if you can get monthly retainers, you can put that concern to rest. 
  
  The key now is going out and getting your next client that’s going to pay you $5k or $10k or $15k per month. 
  
  The first thing we need to do is nail down your niche. What’s the area that you can add a unique value? 
  
  Next, we need to get that in front of potential clients that are the right fit for you.  
  
  So, nail down who would benefit the most from the value you add. Write it down and as many attributes of that client as possible. 
  
  Third, do some research and customized outreach. Ideally within your network there’s someone at the company you know. If not, that’s okay.  
  
  Call out a recent win of the company, let them know about your experience, and ask for a call. 
  
  If you can set-up 10 of these calls, you’re very likely to close a client.  
  
  Just make sure you ask for enough! 
  
  Do you know you have great experience but need help finding these clients?
