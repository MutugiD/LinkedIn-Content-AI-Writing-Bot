After a number of years as a rockstar in tech and getting your MBA, you might be interested in joining a start-up.  
  
  How do you pick one that's a good fit for you? How do you know you'll get along with your boss and agree with leadership? How do you avoid picking one that's a train wreck internally? 
  
  Starting out in a consulting role is a way to get exposure to many companies at once. Once you get some exposure, you can fully commit once you've gotten a chance to work there. 
  
  Further, they'll get to know your work, and end up making you a much better offer than they would have otherwise.  
  
  Interested? Message me, and I can help you make this happen
