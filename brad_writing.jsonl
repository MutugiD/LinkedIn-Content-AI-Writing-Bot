{"prompt": "Launching Uber Eats in Miami was no easy feat, however with the help of a team of five hungry and personable sales reps along with a structured approach and strategy, we recruited over 100 restaurants in just 6 weeks. We modelled what needed to happen every day, created a restaurant sales playbook, set performance bonuses and quotas, shared best practices, and offered lower starter commission rates. Through hard work and team dedication, we were able to exceed our goals and reach the launch date on time with the right partner restaurants.\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " To launch Uber Eats, we had to get 100 restaurants on the platform to go live.  \n  \n  When I launched Miami, we had 6 weeks to do it.  \n  \n  Here's everything we did to make it happen: \n  \n  1. We needed sales reps pounding the pavement. So we hired 5 of them. How we found them quickly? We advertised the role, threw a  happy hour  where we talked to about 40 candidates. We narrowed it down to 10, interviewed them individually, and hired 5 hungry, personable sales folks. \n  \n  2. As the head launcher on a very tight timeline, I had to know what  good  looked like. Meaning what needed to happen every single day to be on target for the launch. So I modeled it out, and shared it with the team. We'd track against the projection every day. \n  \n  3. We designed a restaurant sales playbook so we'd all start with the same pitch. Asking restaurants to give Uber at 30% cut of the gross revenue was a BIG ask. So we needed a really strong pitch. \n  \n  4. We set quotas and performance bonuses for the rep who signed the most restaurants in a week. Nothing like rewarding performance and hustle. \n  \n  5. Every single day we'd get the sales team together and talk about what worked, and what didn't. Things started super slow and we were well behind those targets I'd set. We needed to pick up momentum, so sharing best practices from the top performing reps was KEY. One insight was the best time to catch a decision maker (10am - 11am before lunch and 4-5pm before the dinner rush were ideal times.) \n  \n  6. With harder to close but important restaurants, we'd have a manager step in to close the deal. If a sales rep had the deal close but couldn't get it over the finish line, we'd bring a manager in to support and close. We were a team and we wanted our reps to know they had support. \n  \n  7. We started a number of restaurants on a lower  starter  commission rate. It was a great way to get a restaurant signed up for 25% for 3 months, with the plan to increase after that first 90 days.  \n  \n  8. We hustled. We ground it out. There was no silver bullet. It was a numbers game and a hustle game. We made it a friendly competition amongst the reps, we rallied together as a team, and we got the job done. \n  \n  And all in all, we get 100+ restaurants by the launch day, and made it on time. I will never forget those days. We hustled hard, but we were all in it together as a team. And that made it memorable, enjoyable, and one hell of a challenge."}

{"prompt": "We often act in self-sabotaging ways, procrastinating on tasks we need to be doing instead of getting distracted by comfortable or easy activities. To overcome this we need to have clear objectives and strive to make sure our efforts are moving towards our end goals. We should also create a to-do list with our big rocks and must-do items, and tackle those before anything else. It can be scary to do the hard thing, but we can look at that fear and do it anyway.\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " We know what we need to do to hit our goals. But we procrastinate. We distract ourselves. We work on everything except for what we need to be doing. \n  \n  Here's why (and how you can overcome it). \n  \n  Doing the thing we NEED to do is often scary. It comes with the potential of rejection. It forces us to face a fear. \n  \n  So, we subconsciously put it off. \n  \n  We don't send that outreach email. We don't send that proposal. We avoid getting that feedback.  \n  \n  Instead, we respond to emails in our inboxes and text messages from our friends. We read the news and scroll through social media. \n  \n  We subconsciously know that none of that stuff moves the needle. But we do it because it's comfortable. It's easy. \n  \n  For me, I love building models. I love modeling how Mylance can grow. At this point, I've built at least 50+ models for projecting Mylance's growth. Guess how much that moves the needle? Nearly zero. It's just in my comfort zone. \n  \n  Here's what I'm doing to overcome this (feel free to steal it from me!) \n  \n  1. I have very clear objectives for what I want Mylance to achieve in the next month, quarter, and year. \n  \n  2. I write my monthly goal at the top of my to-do list.  \n  \n  3. Before the week starts, I write my  big rocks  for the week, along with 2  must-do  items for Monday.  \n  \n  I check if these items specifically contribute (i.e., do they move the needle) to my monthly goal that's right above the to-do list. If they don't, I remove them. \n  \n  4. When the work day starts, I tackle my  must-do  items before anything else happens. I don't open email or Slack. I don't respond to anyone. I knock out those needle moving items. It's the ONLY thing that matters in that moment. \n  \n  This way, I can't procrastinate. I can't distract myself. I can't rationalize that I'll  do it tomorrow.   \n  \n  You know the things you need to be doing.  \n  \n  But sometimes, they're scary.  \n  \n  And that's okay.  \n  \n  But if you want to do the hard thing and grow, then we have to look at that scary thing and say  I see you,  and do it anyway."}
{"prompt": "Uber's team was focused on hitting 5 minutes ETAs in a small geography while Lyft was focused on covering the entire area. Uber quickly ramped up their supply and earned the trust of the riders in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area with their detailed marketing strategies, targeted incentives for existing drivers, and local city teams. The result was that Uber had >90% market share 6 months after launch. It teaches us an important lesson - that to win, you don't have to be first, but be focused on the things that matter most.\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " Uber and Lyft both launched UberX in Raleigh on the same day.  \n  \n  Fast forward 6 months, Uber had 90% market share in the area.  \n  \n  Here's how we won: \n  \n  1. Uber's main KPI at the time was ETAs.  \n  \n  When a rider was ready to take a trip, we wanted them to get a driver in under 5 minutes. So we launched in a very small geographic area, and our team worked our butts off to match rider and driver demand so ETAs were under 5 minutes. \n  \n  Thus, we launched Uber in Raleigh in a 7 mile circle in downtown Raleigh in April 2014. \n  \n  Lyft, on the other hand, launched in Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill on that same day. They thought covering the entire area (each of those areas are 30-45 min from each other) would help them win since they were first. \n  \n  However, their result was 10-20 minute ETAs for the entire area. So while Uber wasn't available in Durham & Chapel Hill, Lyft's experience was already sub-par. \n  \n  2. For our team to hit 5 minute ETAs in our small geo, we needed more drivers on the road AND we needed existing drivers to drive when the demand was.  \n  \n  So we did tons of top of funnel marketing: ads, driver referrals, and flyers were the best performing methods. And for existing drivers, we looked closely at the real-time data and we'd design targeted incentives.  \n  \n  When we saw rider demand not being met, we'd target X number of drivers with extra financial incentives to drive during those times so all ETAs were under 5 minutes. Yes, we burned money to meet rider demand. And it worked. \n  \n  3. As we grew our small geo in Raleigh and more and more rides were under a 5 minute ETA, we started to build a driver base in Durham and Chapel Hill. We did driver onboarding events, we advertised that we were  coming soon  and we built up supply so come launch day, we'd cover the area well. And 3 months after we launched Raleigh (and 3 months behind Lyft), we launched Durham and Chapel Hill nearly hitting sub-5 minute ETAs on day 1. \n  \n  4. Uber had local city teams at this time. Meaning my team's sole focus was on the Raleigh-Durham area. We lived, ate, and breathed Uber Raleigh. I worked day and night to grow my market and ensure happy riders and drivers. I answered every single driver support ticket myself.  \n  \n  Lyft, on the other hand, had their company in SF overseeing the United States. They didn't have dedicated city teams. This meant when there were events going on in Raleigh, we knew about it and we'd make sure Uber drivers would be there. I don't know what Lyft did, but their presence lacked, and we'd win the big events. \n  \n  And fast forward 6 months from launch, and Uber had a >90% market share in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area. \n  \n  Uber and Lyft's product wasn't different. Pricing wasn't different. But the go to market strategy, execution, and focus were night and day.  \n  \n  And it taught me a valuable lesson: you don't have to be first. You just have to be focused on what matters most."}

{"prompt": "Launching a two-sided on-demand marketplace such as Uber in 2014 was a challenging task, requiring an effectively established driver base so riders could experience a good journey. To build up the driver base Uber ran a number of processes including background checks, iphone delivery to the drivers and also held in-person onboarding events. Promotional activities such as press releases and boots on the ground events also helped to spread the word to potential riders. Finally, to ensure a good experience was provided to riders the driver base was incentivised through hourly guarantees and uber focused attention on key marketplace metrics such as trips requested, trips completed, % Surge & Driver Hourly Earnings. This playbook was followed to launch and scale Uber quickly across hundreds of cities and create a successful two-sided on-demand marketplace.\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " What launching a city for Uber looked like in 2014: \n  \n  To launch a two-sided on-demand marketplace, the biggest challenge was building up supply (in this case, drivers) so demand needs (rider requests) could be met with a good experience.  \n  \n  For Uber, this meant we needed a concentration of drivers online to accept requests on the road so riders would have a good experience.  \n  \n  To build up the driver base to launch a new city, Uber would: \n  \n  1. Attract driver sign-ups mostly through ads (Craigslist, Indeed) and a referral program \n  \n  2. Run every driver through a background check and get their documents reviewed: license, registration, and insurance \n  \n  3. Once approved, Uber didn't have the ability to let drivers download the app on their phone. So we needed to give an iPhone to every single driver and teach them how to use the app. To do this we held both in-person  onboarding  events and eventually built a delivery process to ship phones. We'd (usually) take a deposit for the phone with the hopes of getting it back. \n  \n  The rider side was a bit easier. We'd work hard to get press, and do a number of  boots on the ground  events to spread the word. \n  \n  I personally went to UNC's orientation in Chapel Hill for the Chapel Hill launch. We tried to sign up every new student onto Uber and were frequently met with  I'm not giving my credit card info, I'll just take a cab!  Funny now looking back. \n  \n  When the launch was ready to go live, we'd launch in a small geography to ensure 5-min ETAs. It was better to serve a small number of customers really well than widen the geo with a sub-par experience. \n  \n  To ensure riders had a good experience, we'd incentivize drivers to stay online through hourly guarantees in a certain geo and accept rider trips. \n  \n  After the launch, we were hyper focused on our marketplace metrics to see how well demand was being met, and if drivers were earning enough. The top three marketplace metrics: \n  \n  1. Rides Completed / Rides Requested \n  2. % of trips surged \n  3. Driver hourly earnings \n  \n  While Uber was far from perfect, we found a way to launch in hundreds of new cities across a few years, following this playbook to scale the local marketplaces quickly!"}

Despite the tough road they have taken, Uber has now accomplished huge milestones and delivered life-changing services around the world. Congratulations to the entire team!\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " Q1 2019, Uber lost nearly $1 billion when it reported earnings. \n  \n  And this wasn\u2019t new: the company often lost nearly $1B per quarter as we heavily invested in the global expansion of Rides and Eats and then additional but significant bets on Autonomous Vehicles, Freight, and VTOL (flying cars). \n  \n  My experience in 2014 reflected this.  \n  \n  As crazy as it was, when I first started we didn\u2019t have a P&L for each city (we soon did get one!) but the truth is, we were focused on growth, and the company was willing to invest heavily in rider and driver incentives to scale quickly and fend off the competition. \n  \n  When I launched Uber Eats in Miami, I had to come up with a 12-month P&L for the city.  \n  \n  By the end of the 12 months, the model showed us squeaking out a profit (barely). When the Head of Uber Eats questioned me on it, I didn\u2019t have much of a response: the unit economics of that business were brutal, and only a perfectly run marketplace would make any money. \n  \n  Fast forward to today, excluding a UK settlement, free cash flow for Uber was $430 million for Q4 2022. \n  \n  Further, the Delivery business line brought in an adjusted EBITDA of $241 million in Q4 2022.  \n  \n  While I\u2019m not on the inside anymore, I can\u2019t understate this incredible achievement for the entire Uber team. \n  \n  While it certainly wasn\u2019t perfectly executed (far from it!!), the people that built Uber from day 1 until today have a ton to be proud of in bringing a life-changing company to cities around the world, taking on billions of VC money, going through an up and down rollercoaster of wins and failures, to a profitable, growing, sustainable company. \n  \n  Congrats team!"}

{"prompt": "I had only recently quit Uber and was unsure of what to do next. After going through the daunting task of responding to recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn, I finally got one positive response from a company that was willing to get on a call with me. \n\nI created a deck that showcased my skills and understanding of their challenges and proposed an arrangement for advisory services, which the company found appealing. After responding to their counteroffer of $250 per hour, I found myself with my first consulting client. At 25 hours a week, I was now making $25k/month! It was a moment that changed my life and trajectory forever.\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " The FULL story of how I got my first $25k / month consulting client: \n  \n  Once I quit Uber and took a little bit of time off, I was ready to start working on what was next. I wanted to start a company. But I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to start.  \n  \n  I also wondered how I was going to support myself. I couldn\u2019t just keep going without income. I considered if I could help out companies part-time. So, I did some outreach. Or rather, I responded to some LinkedIn inbound recruiters and hiring managers. \n  \n  I responded to each of them honestly that I was willing to help them part-time.  \n  \n  Here\u2019s a sample note I sent: \n  \n  Thanks for reaching out. I definitely think my 4 years at Uber could be helpful as AutoX rolls out their self-driving marketplace. Do you see an opportunity for me to help as more of an advisor than a full-time role? I'm currently not in the market for a full-time role, but am open to other arrangements. Let me know your thoughts.  \n  \n  Cheers, \n  Bradley \n  \n  I sent out 12 notes like this. 11 times I got a \u201cno\u201d or just no response. \n  \n  One of the 12, however, responded positively back that they were down to get on a call and chat. \n  \n  I had my first lead. I didn\u2019t call them leads at that time. I didn\u2019t know anything.  \n  \n  I jumped on a call with them and talked about my experience at Uber, and inquired about their needs.  \n  \n  They asked me to send over a proposal of what a working arrangement could look like. I didn\u2019t have a template or any kind of idea what this could look like. So I did what any business minded person does best. I made a deck that included: \n  \n  1. My background \n  2. The terms of the agreement including my rate \n  3. The challenges I understood facing the company \n  4. The questions I expected to address \n  5. A sample food delivery marketplace business model \n  \n  I sent it over. \n  \n  I guess they liked it, because they invited me onsite for an interview (this was long before COVID was an issue). I spoke to a few different members of their team including the CEO and COO. \n  \n  I got a call a few days later from the recruiter that they\u2019d like to offer me the contract, but that my rate was a bit too high. \n  \n  I had made up some random number calculating my Uber salary, projected equity, added in a huge buffer for health insurance and other contractor costs, and divided by 40 hours per week and 49 weeks per year.  \n  \n  It came out to $267 per hour. This felt high, but what did I have to lose?  \n  \n  So when the phone call came in and told me my rate was too high, I got nervous. I couldn\u2019t really defend that rate. But I did something that in hindsight was smart: I asked them to counter. They countered at $250 / hr (only 7% lower than what I\u2019d asked for). I accepted on the spot. Deal.  \n  \n  While the contract was hourly, if I worked 20 hours per week I\u2019d make $20k per month, and at 25 hours per week, I\u2019d make $25k per month. \n  \n  Score! \n  \n  I had my first consulting client. And it changed my life forever.  \n  \n  If you want a copy of the deck I sent over, add a comment below and I'll send it over to you!"}

{"prompt": "As a fractional executive, standing out from the competition by emphasizing industry and company-building experience, unique skills, and tenure is essential. Showcasing these unique talents in combination can help solidify a customer's decision in choosing you over another candidate. Examples include being a data-driven Fractional COO with a decade of experience in the cannabis industry and additional expertise in SQL, R, and Python or a Fractional COO with additional experience in marketing funnels and email copywriting.\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " The need to differentiate yourself as a fractional executive is obvious.  \n  \n  But what separates one Fractional COO/CMO/CFO from another? \n  \n  Let's look at some examples to differentiate and win clients: \n  \n  1. Industry experience: you can be a Fractional COO differentiated in an industry, specifically one that largely benefits from industry experience. E.g., Healthcare has lots of regulation and nuance, so having this experience will matter a lot to your clients. \n  \n  2. In conjunction with another function. Let's say you're a Fractional COO but also have finance experience.

Comparing a  Fractional COO  with a  Data-Driven Fractional COO with SQL, Python, and R expertise  is night and day. While the company may not have these as an immediate need, it's certainly nice to have for the future and makes you an obvious choice over someone without these skills. \n  \n  4. Company-building experience. Let's say you're a Fractional COO who was also a founder with fundraising experience. Adding this experience to your pitch is a huge differentiator to the right client. Call out a specific, value-add experience you've had that bolsters your pitch. Examples could be fundraising, sales, marketing, design, or analytics (and there are thousands more). \n  \n  5. Tenure. Do clients want to hire brand new Fractional COOs or experienced ones? It seems obvious, but it's left out of many niches. If you have 10 years of experience, call that out. A  Fractional COO with a decade of experience  sounds a lot more compelling than just a  Fractional COO. \n  \n  Put this into practice: \n  \n  1. Fractional COO specializing in Cannabis \n  \n  2.

So we hired 5 reps within 1 week by inviting candidates to a  happy hour,  narrowed it down to 10, interviewed them individually, and hired 5 hungry, personable sales folks. \n  \n  2. Planning ahead of time. As the launcher on a very tight timeline, I had to know what  good  looked like. Meaning how many restaurants we needed to close every single day to be on target for the launch. So I modeled it, shared it with the team, and tracked against the projection daily.  \n  \n  3. Designing and refining the pitch. We needed a STRONG message to convince restaurants to partner with us and give us 30%. So we came up with a plan that would resonate and then iterated on it with every pitch. We'd circle up each day, share what worked and what didn't, and learn from each other.  \n  \n  4. We set quotas for how many restaurants the reps were supposed to close each day and each week, and we made it a friendly competition. We were on the same team, but also trying to  win.  Closing more restaurants resulted in performance bonuses and recognition. \n  \n  5. We hustled but stayed patient. Getting the reps up to speed took some time, and sales started off slowly - we were well behind those targets I'd set. We needed to pick up momentum, so sharing best practices from the top-performing reps was KEY. One insight was the best time to catch a decision maker (10am - 11am before lunch and 4-5pm before the dinner rush were ideal times.) \n  \n  6. With harder-to-close but important restaurants, we'd have a manager step in to close the deal. If a sales rep had the deal close but couldn't get it over the finish line, we'd bring a manager in to support and close. We were a team and we wanted our reps to know they had support. \n  \n  7. We closed a number of restaurants by agreeing to a lower  starter  commission rate. It was a great way to get a restaurant signed up for 25% for 3 months, with the plan to increase after that first 90 days. \n  \n  8. We hustled. We grinded it out. There was no silver bullet. It was a numbers game and a hustle game. We made it a friendly competition amongst the reps, we rallied together as a team, and we got the job done. \n  \n  And all in all, we did get 100+ restaurants by the launch day, and launched on time.  \n  \n  It took an incredible amount of grit and hustle, but also smart planning, patience, and iteration. \n  \n  I remind myself of those days as I build my company now. Even with the resources Uber had, it still took a ton of persistence and iteration to be successful. There are no shortcuts in business. You have to put in the hard and smart work to win."}

People want to work with interesting humans. Share some of your hobbies. \n  \n  3. I have contact links easily accessible so people can get in touch with me or sign-up. Let's face it: your LinkedIn doesn\u2019t do a great job of sharing your portfolio, case studies, testimonials, or your brand.

{"prompt": "Instead of raising a pre-seed round with the associated equity giving away, I found a consulting client that brought in $8.5k per month while only working five to ten hours a week. This enabled me to devote 90% of my time to my start-up, Mylance, without having to part with any equity. Over the course of the first year, I was able to gain traction, and from there was capable of raising a small round with a higher valuation.

{"prompt": "Launching a successful product can be daunting, but with careful planning, utilizing resources, and plenty of hustle, amazing success can be achieved, as Uber Eats in Miami demonstrated. Prior to the launch day, Uber Eats spent six weeks of hectic preparation, focusing on a small geography and converting existing Uber riders to eaters. Couriers were also recruited from sources such as Craigslist and autoshops. They also tested the product internally and externally to get as much feedback as possible to refine the experience. Finally, they spent time pounding the pavement to get as many quality restaurants on board as possible. All these steps and resources paid off in droves with 1,003 orders on the first day.  These lessons can prove helpful when launching new products in today's competitive market.\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " Uber Eats in Miami launched on July 12th, 2016.  \n  \n  On the first day, we did 1,003 orders making it one of the most successful launches at that time.  \n  \n  Here's what happened on the inside to make our launch day a success:  \n  \n  1. A successful launch is all about what happens in the weeks and days leading up to it. The launch day is almost  after the fact.  So, we did 6 weeks of hectic but carefully planned prep to give ourselves the best chance at success. \n  \n  2. We launched in a small geography. With a live logistics marketplace, trying to cover a large area is really difficult. We preferred to create a great experience to a smaller number of customers rather than a mediocre one to a larger audience. \n  \n  3. We utilized our resources, namely existing riders already on the Uber app. Uber Miami was already a big business. We didn't need to reinvent a brand new marketing strategy. We tried to convert as many existing riders to new eaters as possible, and didn't use promotions to do it. We did give away free delivery for the first few weeks. \n  \n  4. For couriers, we didn't want to disrupt the rides business, so we used drivers who didn't previously qualify for Uber (based on the age or size of their car), in addition to onboarding new ones by advertising on Craigslist, Indeed, and posting flyers at autoshops and bike stores. \n  \n  5. We did a lot of testing. We did an internal launch 2 weeks before the actual launch day to the internal office. We tested all the restaurants, gave feedback to the couriers, and made sure the systems worked. Then we did a soft launch to a small list of highly engaged Uber Riders a few days before to make sure everything worked externally. We collected as much feedback as we could. \n  \n  6. Pounded the pavement to onboard as many quality restaurants as possible. We knew customers wanted diversity. To have a successful launch, customers needed to go into the app and see a restaurant they liked. Our benchmark was 100 quality restaurants (based on Yelp reviews) in 4 weeks. That takes a lot of calls, meetings, selling, and closing. \n  \n  Given Uber was well funded, we certainly had plenty of resources behind us to make this launch a success. That being said, it still took a ton of planning, strategy, and pure hustle to put it all together. \n  \n  When I think about launching a new product in my business today, I remember these lessons from Uber and spend all my time in the planning phase to give myself the best chance for success."}

{"prompt": "Uber has seen tremendous success in a short period of time due to the innovation and creativity of its Ops teams. They experimented with new product features to test their ROI, quickly launched into new cities, empowered city teams to run their own operations, and recruited tech-savvy professionals rather than hiring from the taxi industry. These measures have been integral for Uber's success and have provided a great example of how tech companies can Scales quickly.\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " While Uber is no doubt a tech company driven by its product, Ops played a huge role early on in differentiating against the competition. \n  \n  Here are 4 ways Ops helped grow Uber to a multi-billion company in a few short years: \n  \n  1. Experimentation.  \n  \n  For new product features, Ops teams had to prove the ROI and use case. We built hacky solutions to A/B test solutions to see what worked. That way, the product teams already knew the solutions would be successful. We'd start an experiment in one city. If it worked, we'd add a few cities, and then a few more. We'd get statistically significant results, and then share with the product teams to review and add to the roadmap. \n  \n  2. New city launches \n  \n  Uber had designated city launchers that would travel the world, launch a new city, and hand off the business to a GM / city team. These people would navigate the regulations, acquire customers, set up the internal tools structure, implement a quick marketing plan, and make sure the launch went successfully before they moved on.  \n  \n  3. Ops acted as city CEOs.  \n  \n  For the first 6-7 years of the company, city teams had full ownership over their cities. They had sole discretion of comms, pricing, incentives, events, and even loyalty programs. Uber eventually needed to unify this under one roof, but in the early days, Uber hired talented, ambitious leaders and gave them full ownership to empower them to grow their cities, and it WORKED. These leaders would share best practices with the other city GMs, enabling cities and regions to grow in tandem.  \n  \n  4. Ops leaders came from tech, not transportation.  \n  \n  Uber didn't hire taxi dispatchers to build a global ridesharing operation. Instead, they hired experienced leaders from tech, consulting, engineering, and finance. These people had strong EQs to be customer-facing, but also had the talent to run operations, marketing, and finance. Further, they didn't come from the taxi or black car industries, thus weren't biased in how to grow a transportation network. They could re-think it from scratch and implement innovative solutions to problems. \n  \n  There's no right way to build a company. But the experience at Uber taught me a ton about how a tech company can find PMF and then quickly scale to millions of users."}

{"prompt": "When Uber and Lyft both launched UberX in Raleigh, Uber had a vision to provide a fast and reliable service to their customers, and executed it masterfully. Through the launch of their services in a small 7 mile circle, working hard to ensure ETAs were under 5 minutes, targeted incentives to existing drivers, and local city teams dedicated to the Raleigh-Durham area, Uber was able to secure a 90%+ market share over the course of 6 months. This story serves as a lesson that success is not only determined by being first, but by focusing on the most important activities, having fast reactions in market, and understanding local demand.\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " Uber and Lyft both launched UberX in Raleigh on the same day. \n  \n  Fast forward 6 months, Uber had 90% market share in the area. \n  \n  Here's how we won: \n  \n  1. Uber's main KPI at the time was ETAs. \n  \n  When a rider was ready to take a trip, we wanted them to get a driver in under 5 minutes. So we launched in a very small geographic area, and our team worked our butts off to match rider and driver demand so ETAs were under 5 minutes. \n  \n  Thus, we launched Uber in Raleigh in a 7 mile circle in downtown Raleigh in April 2014. \n  \n  Lyft, on the other hand, launched in Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill on that same day. They thought covering the entire area (each of those areas are 30-45 min from each other) would help them win since they were first. \n  \n  However, their result was 10-20 minute ETAs for the entire area. So while Uber wasn't available in Durham & Chapel Hill, Lyft's experience was already sub-par. \n  \n  2. For our team to hit 5 minute ETAs in our small geo, we needed more drivers on the road AND we needed existing drivers to drive when the demand was. \n  \n  So we did tons of top of funnel marketing: ads, driver referrals, and flyers were the best performing methods. And for existing drivers, we looked closely at the real-time data and we'd design targeted incentives. \n  \n  When we saw rider demand not being met, we'd target X number of drivers with extra financial incentives to drive during those times so all ETAs were under 5 minutes. Yes, we burned money to meet rider demand. And it worked. \n  \n  3. As we grew our small geo in Raleigh and more and more rides were under a 5 minute ETA, we started to build a driver base in Durham and Chapel Hill. We did driver onboarding events, we advertised that we were  coming soon  and we built up supply so come launch day, we'd cover the area well. And 3 months after we launched Raleigh (and 3 months behind Lyft), we launched Durham and Chapel Hill nearly hitting sub-5 minute ETAs on day 1. \n  \n  4. Uber had local city teams at this time. Meaning my team's sole focus was on the Raleigh-Durham area. We lived, ate, and breathed Uber Raleigh. I worked day and night to grow my market and ensure happy riders and drivers. I answered every single driver support ticket myself. \n  \n  Lyft, on the other hand, had their company in SF overseeing the United States. They didn't have dedicated city teams. This meant when there were events going on in Raleigh, we knew about it and we'd make sure Uber drivers would be there. I don't know what Lyft did, but their presence lacked, and we'd win the big events. \n  \n  And fast forward 6 months from launch, and Uber had a >90% market share in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area. \n  \n  Uber and Lyft's product wasn't different. Pricing wasn't different. But the go to market strategy, execution, and focus were night and day. \n  \n  And it taught me a valuable lesson: you don't have to be first.

Rejection may be tough to swallow, but if approached with resilience it can ultimately lead to greater success in the consulting world. So stay determined and keep rolling with the punches.\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " Our short story wraps up today with: \ud83e\udd4a  Rolling with the Punches: Facing Rejection and Silencing the Imposter Villain in Your Consulting Journey \n  \n  Rejection is an inevitable part of any consulting career, and it can be a jarring experience, regardless if you're just starting out, or if you're a seasoned professional.  \n  \n  In these moments, the Imposter Villain may try to make a comeback, exploiting your vulnerabilities and casting doubt on your abilities. \n  \n  In this post, we tackle how to face rejection head-on, silence the Imposter Villain once more, and emerge stronger than before. \n  \n  1. Embrace the Learning Opportunity: Instead of letting rejection derail your progress, view it as a chance to grow.  \n  \n  Analyze the situation, identify areas for improvement, and use this newfound knowledge to refine your approach.

{"prompt": "The launch of Uber Freight back in 2016 was a major success, culminating in a successful $4B valuation just four years later. This was no mean feat, as the Uber Freight business bore no synergies to Uber's core business and required a startup approach within the larger umbrella company. This included user research and conversations with truck drivers to understand needs, an initial reliance on antiquated software as well as carefully managed budgets from Uber itself and a deliberate focus on a single type of freight. Ultimately, it was the hustle and automation of processes that drove the success of Uber Freight and proved that success, even within a larger organisation, is attainable with the right know-how.\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " Uber Freight launched in 2016 and grew to a $4B valuation in 4 years. This business line has zero synergies with Uber's core business. \n  \n  Here\u2019s how it happened: \n  \n  In early 2017 I moved out to SF to help launch Uber Freight. It was building a \u201cfrom scratch\u201d start-up within a billion dollar company.  \n  \n  Here\u2019s what we did: \n  \n  1. We did user research like any other company. We went to truck stops in Dallas, TX and spoke to truck drivers. We recorded all the conversations in a Google form. We reviewed answers weekly and found common threads. \n  \n  2. We grew without a product. We moved loads manually in the early days using existing, antiquated software. We could see the good and bad about existing solutions, and we were getting users. \n  \n  3. Uber acted basically as our \u201cVC fund.\u201d They would give us a small budget to hit a milestone. Once we did, we got more. Each year we\u2019d pitch them asking for a new. While this was way easier than an actual VC round, we spent COUNTLESS hours preparing these decks. It wasn\u2019t as easy as you might think. \n  \n  4. While we had access to Uber\u2019s resources, it was hard to take advantage. First, the customer segments do not overlap. At all. Uber Freight matches shippers and carriers. This has nothing to do with riders and drivers. It\u2019s a B2B marketplace with long sales cycles. Secondly, Uber didn\u2019t let us take really anyone from the core business. We couldn\u2019t hire ANYONE. We had to hire externally to avoid disrupting the core business. \n  \n  5. We stayed focused. Despite an absolutely enormous market, we focused only on 53\u2019 dry van truckload freight in the US for YEARS. We easily could\u2019ve expanded to flatbed and many other kinds, but we didn\u2019t. There was a multi-billion dollar market in that one focus area alone, so we kept at it. \n  \n  6. We hustled - we did whatever it took to onboard new customers. That including cold calling hundreds of new Freight carriers per day, and testing new ways to get them onboarded onto the app. We found that if we had a \u201cgood\u201d load for them, they were likely to sign up. So we used the carrot method and called them, trying to get them to use the app for their second load. \n  \n  Uber Freight was a startup trying to find product market fit just like any other pre-seed company! \n  \n  We moved one load after another. We automated everything we could. We hustled and we pushed through tough challenges. It\u2019s never easy. It\u2019s just different levels of hard."}

{"prompt": "Uber Freight started from humble beginnings in 2017 with a small team of employees manually moving 5-10 loads a day. Through dedicated user research, shipper sales, and a driver-facing app, the team was able to grow the company from scratch to a $4B valuation in just 5 years. During this time, they focused on a constant balance between growth, automation, and margin, and hustled incredibly hard to become a relevant line item before the Uber IPO.\n\n SUMMARY: ", "completion": " The Freight market in the US is an $800 billion industry, with the Freight Brokerage market being ~10% of that at $80+ billion.  \n  \n  Here's how Uber Freight started from scratch, broke in, and became worth $1B within 2 years of being founded. \n  \n  First, Uber acquired Otto. The acquisition was originally for self-driving tech, but the small team at Otto was also in the process of building a freight marketplace, so Uber inherited that in the acquisition, and with the acquisition, the team kept building the freight marketplace.  \n  \n  Things that don't scale \n  At this time (early 2017), all loads were moved manually. We were using antiquated freight software, calling truck drivers manually, and moving loads the traditional way: with emails, texts, calls, and old software. We probably moved 5-10 loads per day. \n  \n  User Research \n  At the same time, we were building tech. But we didn't know exactly what to build. We needed to do user research and figure out the problems to be solved and jobs to be done. \n  \n  So a small group of us would jump on a flight, go to Dallas, TX, and go to truck stops. There we'd interview as many truck drivers as we could, learn their problems, document everything, and compile the results. \n  \n  Shipper Sales \n  At the same time, shipper sales reps reached out to medium and enterprise shippers getting loads. They would sell shippers on the future vision of Uber Freight: a digital marketplace where you could track your loads in real-time. By selling the vision, they had a lot of early success, and of course, having the  Uber  name helped a lot in these conversations. \n  \n  Product Development \n  Based on our research, we decided to build a driver-facing app that allowed them to book a load directly. While not novel tech, this was quite novel for the freight industry as drivers were used to haggling over the phone.  \n  \n  As a team, we wanted to grow and move more and more loads. So once the tech was built, we'd try to get as many drivers to use the app as possible. We'd call them, onboard them onto the app, and teach them how to use it. \n  \n  We hired a team of call agents who would spend all day every day calling drivers. We found that onboarding them onto the app was useless unless we had a load for them. So we'd actually look at the loads first, then call drivers in that area and onboard them onto the app to accept that load. The more well-paying loads we had, the better our driver app adoption was. \n  \n  And that's what we focused on for 2 straight years. When we couldn't get a load taken on the app, we had a team moving freight manually, as our commitment to the shipper was getting the load moved. \n  \n  It was a constant balance between growth, automation, and margin, and the entire team would hustle incredibly hard to become a relevant line item before the Uber IPO.  \n  \n  And by the time Uber would go public, the business unit would be a material line item and is now valued at over $4B, only 5 years after being founded."}

This allowed them to be more nimble and responsive to local events and trends, and to build stronger relationships with riders and drivers in the area. \n  \n  4.

E.g., if I quit my job, go out on my own, and completely strike out for 3 months, will I be OK? Could I get another job? Usually, the answer is yes and the bigger worst case scenario is never trying on my own. \n  \n  4. Journaling. I journal a lot. Nearly every day now. I journal the thoughts in my head. I get them down on paper which gets them out of my head. It helps me to stop worrying in my down time, add them to my to-do list, and work on them during productive working hours. \n  \n  5. I surround myself with motivated, high-value people all pursuing their dreams. The reality is if you put yourself out there and try new things, you\u2019re going to fail a lot.
