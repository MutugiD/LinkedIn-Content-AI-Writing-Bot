Nobody hands you a business on a silver platter. 
  
  I hear this a lot from customers.  
  
  They want a $20k consulting project that comes from a marketplace.  
  
  But having $20k / month for your consulting is you running your own business.  
  
  Clients are customers, and you have to work for them. 
  
  Nothing is given to you. Nothing is easy.  
  
  But it is doable. With hard work and consistency, you will get what you want. Just be ready to put in the work.
