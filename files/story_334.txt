 I'd love to make some side-income from consulting 
  
  It's a great idea, and the thought of adding value part-time to a company and having some extra cash sounds amazing. 
  
  Having this as an idea, and actually making it happen are quite different. Here's the quick playbook: 
  
  1. Detail your intentions. How much money do you want to make? How many hours do you have available? Why are you doing this? 
  
  2. Define your unique value add. Actually write it out - this will be important later. 
  
  3. Decide who's your ideal client. Who is likely to benefit the most from your unique set of skills / experiences? 
  
  4. Reach out directly to folks you've worked with in the past. Ask them about their company and their challenges. Tell them what you're up to. If there's not a fit, ask them for an introduction to someone else. 
  
  5. Research companies that fit your target client. Do some LinkedIn stalking and cold reach out asking for a phone call. Use a one-line sentence to validate yourself in that outreach (that you detailed in step 2). 
  
  It may take a few conversations, but if you have 10 conversations, I bet you find your first client.  
  
  Have any tips to add?
