The world we live is in more remote and flexible than ever before. People are working from home, from beaches, from their yoga mats. People are leaving “corporate America” to work for themselves or start a company with a friend, increasing their autonomy, intentionality, and fulfillment in their work lives. 
    
  Q3 2020 saw 1.48 million new business applications filed in the US, a 70% increase over the same quarter the year before. 
    
  Millions are starting new ventures, whether founding companies, becoming a coach, learning to teach yoga, or building a consulting business. They’re taking control of the life THEY want to live. 
  
  As we wind down 2021 and move towards 2022, what is something you've always wanted to do, but something is holding you back? 
  
  Now is the time to spend the time figuring out what you want your work-life to look like in 2022.  
  
  This holiday season, I present an opportunity for you to think about your ideal situation. What do you want your life to look like? Don’t think about the logistics of “how” you’ll make it happen. That’s for another day. Today we’re thinking about “what” it looks like. 
  
  What do I want my days to look like? 
  How do I want to feel? 
  Who do I want to surround yourself with? 
  
  Remove the expectations. The expectations of younger yourself. The expectations of your parents. Of your family. Of your friends. Of your partner.  
  
  We feel whole, fulfilled, full of energy, and loving life only when we’re doing what WE want. Not what someone else wants for us. 
  
  The most loving thing you can do for yourself this Holiday season is take some time for you. If you won’t, who will?
