Such an impactful Accelerator session on negotiation with Robbie Taylor today. Here are some takeaways: 
  
  1. You can go an entire negotiation without discussing an hourly rate. In fact, it's preferred. If your discussion is about the value to the client and deliverables, you're way ahead. 
  
  2. Add in exit clauses so you're guaranteed a ramp-off period (2 months!) with a client, and you're never left  high and dry  with no clients all of a sudden. 
  
  3. Be clear on what  good  looks like for you. Our mindset is always  more  which sets us up to be unhappy. Know your floor and have the self-respect to stick to it. When it goes below, say  no. 
  
  4. Build an emotional connection with your client by seeking to understand their point of view.  
  
  5. Focus on what you can do for them. This isn't about you. This is about solving a problem for your client. Selling yourself misses their point entirely. 
  
  6. Go first, anchor high, and sound confident (whether you are or not) about that number. 
  
  7. If they throw out an offer you don't like. Politely decline it. They might negotiate against themselves and immediately throw out a higher number. 
  
  8. Don't negotiate against yourself. If they say  no,  ask them what they would propose. Don't throw out another number.
