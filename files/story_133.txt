How I use part-time experts in my business: 
  
  As a start-up that's not VC funded, we run a VERY lean team. Thus, having part-time folks that don't require a full salary or benefits keeps our costs down while we iterate, find PMF, and grow. 
  
  But more importantly, the experts I bring in help me avoid trial and error that I might otherwise have with full time employees. 
  
  I can hire people that have been there, done that in past roles, and bring that expertise to me at Mylance. 
  
  This is a game-changer for start-ups. Why re-invent the wheel if you can hire a part-time expert who's done something similar in a past role?
