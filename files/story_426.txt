My biggest learning so far from Mylance came while I was talking to our first few customers.  
  
  There was a strong willingness to pay (over $1000) for this product that helped them take their tech experience, and turn it into lucrative freelance gigs. I'm talking about $10k to $20k per month in part-time work.  
  
  It seemed crazy people were willing to pay that much. But, we weren't just selling a freelance bootcamp. We were selling a new way of working. A new way of supporting yourself and your family: 
  
  1. With flexibility 
  2. Earning your true value in the market 
  3. Working on projects you genuinely wanted to work on 
  
  Customers agreed to pay because they saw a life they wanted, and were willing to invest in the pursuit of that life. 
  
  When you think about it, that's inexpensive relative to other options that provide a similar outcome, like an MBA that costs over $100,000.  
  
  Recent bootcamp graduates are getting they money's worth: making more than their previous salaries in fewer hours, giving them incredible flexibility.  
  
  I know not everyone can afford the money for this transformation, and we're working to bring the cost down to help more people find fulfilling work. 
  
  We spend so much time working, might as well enjoy it!
