I get caught up in it all: comparing Mylance to other start-ups, wanting so badly for us to be bigger, grow faster, have more cash on hand. 
  
  I'm working hard to appreciate what I do have and what I have built. 
  
  This quote resonated with me, and how much happier I'd be if I stopped comparing and just enjoyed what I do have.
