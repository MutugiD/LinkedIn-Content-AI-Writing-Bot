PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

When I left Uber, I went through my LinkedIn inbound messages and responded that I wasn't open to full-time jobs, but I would be open to helping part-time as a consultant.  
  
  It was a shot in the dark. I had no idea if this was possible for someone like me. 
  
  I responded to 12 companies. 11 said  no  or didn't respond. 1 responded favorably, and asked to talk further. 
  
  That one company who did respond ended up being my first consulting client.  
  
  You're not going to shoot 100%. Or even 50%. But if you put yourself out there enough times, you're going to eventually find success. 
  
  I didn't know what was possible until I asked for it. And turns out not only was it possible, but it would change my life forever. 
  
  What do you have to lose? The bigger loss is not ever trying.

I will write a spinned story after mastering the tone, persona and style of writing when prompted:

RESPONSE:

When I left Uber, I had no idea what my next step should be. I had no idea if it was even possible to take on a part-time consulting job. But I decided to take a shot in the dark and responded to 12 companies, letting them know I was open to consulting on a part-time basis. 

Out of the 12 companies, only one responded favorably and asked to talk further. It was that one company that ended up becoming my first consulting client. 

Sometimes, you just have to go out and try. You may not hit the bullseye every time, but you increase your chances of success by putting yourself out there. You won't know what's possible until you ask for it. 

Take the leap and see what happens. You only have something to gain. #justtryit #putyourselfoutthere #makeithappen
