When I left Uber, I knew I wanted to do something on my own. I didn't know what, but I was open to trying new things. To fund these experiments, I wanted to find a part-time, contract role that paid the bills. 
  
  So, I started responding to Linkedin messages from recruiters saying I wasn't looking for a full-time job, but I was open to part-time. I responded to 12 companies. 11 companies either didn't respond or told me no. One company said they were open to it. 
  
  That ended up being my first client, and the start of my freelance consulting  career.  The 11 rejections hurt a little. Being told  no  is never fun. But it's going to be part of the process if you're going to try new things, so better get used to it sooner or later. 
  
  Look at  no  as an opportunity. If you don't get told no, you haven't pushed hard enough or asked for enough. Make sure you find  no  before you agree to a  yes.
