Partnering with a former Uber colleague to consult removed my need to do lead gen, and resulted in the largest 5-figure per month deals I’d ever closed.  
  
  Here’s how it worked: 
  
  1. Importantly, this person is a close friend and former colleague, meaning I trust him. This is crucial because we created a partnership LLC and shared a bank account. Only do this with someone you fully trust. 
  
  2. His niche is completely different but complimentary to mine. He's an expert in BD, Sales, and Marketing. I'm in Operations, Strategy, and Launch.  
  
  3. He'd scour his network, get calls set-up, and then I'd join to help scope projects and close deals. 
  
  4. Sometimes it made more sense for one of us to take the project alone, and we would do that. Otherwise we split every project 50/50 without worrying about minor  I did more work on this one  convos. It all came out in the wash. 
  
  5. We'd pitch ourselves as this dynamic duo that could do BD / Marketing but also Operations and Automation. For many of our logistics clients, it was the perfect combo. 
  
  6. Because we could add so much more value to our clients, we could charge a lot more. Our biggest deal was $35k / month for part-time work! 
  
  Regardless of your skillset, finding a compliment to you and joining forces can make a lot of sense, and remove the part of the business you dislike doing.
