{"prompt": "When I tell people Uber Freight became a $1B brand in 2 years, they often think it\u2019s because of Uber\u2019s significant investment in money and resources. \n  \n  On the inside, it felt like a completely different story. \n  \n  The first two things we did had nothing to do with how much money Uber raised: \n  \n  1. We talked to users.  \n  \n  We went to truck stops in Dallas, Texas and spoke to a few hundred truck drivers. We asked them about their pain points, we took detailed notes, and we compiled all our data so we could analyze and find takeaways. \n  \n  2. We did things that don\u2019t scale.  \n  \n  We moved loads manually. While moving freight loads isn\u2019t super novel, it allowed us to get into the weeds of what a tech product would need to look like, and automate from the inside out. Further, it helped us build relationships with our users and get off the ground so that when the tech was ready, we'd have users to adopt it. \n  \n  At some level, it doesn\u2019t matter how many resources you have.  \n  \n  While it certainly helps to be able to hire talented people to build the company, there are no shortcuts to finding product market fit and building tech that users will actually use!\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " When I tell people that Uber Freight became a $1B brand in two years, they're often surprised.

{"prompt": "While Uber is no doubt a tech company driven by its product, Ops played a huge role early on in differentiating against the competition. \n  \n  Here are 4 ways Ops helped grow Uber to a multi-billion company in a few short years: \n  \n  1. Experimentation.  \n  \n  For new product features, Ops teams had to prove the ROI and use case. We built hacky solutions to A/B test solutions to see what worked. That way, the product teams already knew the solutions would be successful. We'd start an experiment in one city. If it worked, we'd add a few cities, and then a few more. We'd get statistically significant results, and then share with the product teams to review and add to the roadmap. \n  \n  2. New city launches \n  \n  Uber had designated city launchers that would travel the world, launch a new city, and hand off the business to a GM / city team. These people would navigate the regulations, acquire customers, set up the internal tools structure, implement a quick marketing plan, and make sure the launch went successfully before they moved on.  \n  \n  3. Ops acted as city CEOs.  \n  \n  For the first 6-7 years of the company, city teams had full ownership over their cities. They had sole discretion of comms, pricing, incentives, events, and even loyalty programs. Uber eventually needed to unify this under one roof, but in the early days, Uber hired talented, ambitious leaders and gave them full ownership to empower them to grow their cities, and it WORKED. These leaders would share best practices with the other city GMs, enabling cities and regions to grow in tandem.  \n  \n  4. Ops leaders came from tech, not transportation.  \n  \n  Uber didn't hire taxi dispatchers to build a global ridesharing operation. Instead, they hired experienced leaders from tech, consulting, engineering, and finance. These people had strong EQs to be customer-facing, but also had the talent to run operations, marketing, and finance. Further, they didn't come from the taxi or black car industries, thus weren't biased in how to grow a transportation network. They could re-think it from scratch and implement innovative solutions to problems. \n  \n  There's no right way to build a company. But the experience at Uber taught me a ton about how a tech company can find PMF and then quickly scale to millions of users.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The success of Uber is a testament to the power of operations.

{"prompt": "When Uber and Lyft both launched Raleigh on the same day in 2014, no one could have predicted the outcome.  \n  \n  Six months later, Uber had 90% market share in the area. 4 things Uber did to come out on top: \n  \n  1. Focused on a small geographic area: Instead of trying to cover the entire region, Uber launched in a 7-mile circle in downtown Raleigh, where demand was highest. This allowed them to match rider and driver demand more effectively and keep ETAs under 5 minutes, which was their main KPI at the time. \n  \n  2. Used targeted incentives to get more drivers on the road: To achieve their ambitious ETAs, Uber needed more drivers on the road, especially during peak hours. So they used data analysis to identify times when demand was high and offered targeted financial incentives to drivers who were willing to work during those times. \n  \n  3. Leveraged local city teams: Unlike Lyft, which was headquartered in San Francisco and oversaw operations nationwide, Uber had dedicated city teams in Raleigh. This allowed them to be more nimble and responsive to local events and trends, and to build stronger relationships with riders and drivers in the area. \n  \n  4. Focused on quality over quantity: While Lyft was busy expanding to neighboring cities like Durham and Chapel Hill, Uber stayed focused on improving the rider and driver experience in their core market. They worked closely with drivers to address concerns and feedback, and made sure every support ticket was answered promptly. \n  \n  The lesson for other startups is clear: don't try to do everything at once.  \n  \n  Focus on a core market, listen to your customers, and execute flawlessly.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " When Uber and Lyft both descended upon Raleigh in 2014, nobody could have predicted the outcome. Six months later, Uber had a staggering 90% market share in the area. How did they do it? Here are 4 key strategies. \n\nFirst, they kept their focus tight. Instead of trying to cover the entire region, Uber opted to launch within a 7-mile radius around downtown Raleigh - the area with the highest demand. This allowed them to match drivers and riders better and keep ETAs under 5 minutes, their primary goal at the time. \n\nSecond, Uber used targeted incentives to get more drivers on the road. They tapped into data to identify peak hours and then offered additional financial incentives to drivers who were willing to work during those times. \n\nThird, Uber\u2019s local city teams gave them an advantage over Lyft, which was based in San Francisco and ran operations from there. Uber\u2019s local teams allowed them to be more agile and respond to local events and trends quickly, while also building stronger relationships with riders and drivers in the area. \n\nFinally, Uber focused on quality over quantity.
