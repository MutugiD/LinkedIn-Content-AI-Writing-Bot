I was wanting a side hustle. But I couldn't find the energy after work to get it off the ground. My 9-5 was draining!  
  
  So I quit. But I did something first.  
  
  I polished my resume. I applied to a few jobs. I took some interviews. I found out my value in the market. 
  
  I didn't want another job. Frankly, I never wanted another job.  
  
  But I wanted a back-up plan. A safety net.  
  
  I'm a risk taker, but a calculated risk taker. In the case going out on my own didn't work out, I wanted to know that I could go back, and what I could go back to. 
  
  This helped my confidence and imposter syndrome a ton. I saw my value in the market, and so when I reached out to clients for my consulting business, I felt like I had nothing to lose, and everything to gain. 
  
  I don't know what it is for you, but find something that gives you the confidence to put yourself out there, showcase your abilities, ask for high rates, and close.
