The start of the new year is always a time of reflection. As I look back on my career, I can clearly see the difference between the two paths I chose. 

When I worked in Corporate at Uber, I was paid a total annual compensation of $180k. On any given day, I might have had up to 6 hours of meetings, and I worked an average of 65 hours per week. That means my average hourly rate was $56. 

On the other hand, when I decided to step out of the corporate world and become an expert consultant, I was able to double my annual income. My total annual compensation was $310k, I only had 1 hour of meetings per day, and I worked an average of 30 hours per week. That means my average hourly rate was a whopping $210. 

At the end of the day, it's up to you to decide which path you want to take. But whatever you choose, know that it's the right decision for you.
