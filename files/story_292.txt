Going out on our own, no matter what we've done in our past, is scary. It's unknown. It's uncertain. 
  
  Today we had an amazing imposter syndrome, intention setting, and overcoming challenges workshop in our Accelerator today led by the incredible Kristen Esquivias, PCC, CPCC.  
  
  A big thing we worked on is normalizing our fears. Fears around the unknown, around challenging the status quo, around failing. Those emotions all come with going out on our own. 
  
  And yet we want the benefits it provides. We want freedom, flexibility, and ownership over our work. We want to command our own rates, close gender pay gaps, and work without bureaucracy. 
  
  So we have two choices. We can stay where we are, accept the status quo and choose to make our situation as fulfilling as possible. 
  
  OR, we can take the leap. We can jump, put our best foot forward, and see what happens. We're not alone. In fact, we're in great company. 
  
  What will we regret more? Going out on our own and getting rejected, or never trying it in the first place?
