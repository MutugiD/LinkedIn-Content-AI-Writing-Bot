**AMA Alert!** 
  
  After leaving Uber in 2018, I spun up a consulting business that funded my life while I explored other projects. 
  
  I earned ~$25k / month while I tested blogs, e-commerce, a travel tech company, writing, and more. 
  
  When I settled on the idea for Mylance in late 2019, I wound down consulting to only $10k / month in as few hours per week as possible, which funded my life while I was getting Mylance off the ground. 
  
  There's no right way to consult, but it sure is powerful when used correctly. 
  
  Today I'm hosting an AMA here in the comments. I'd love to help you find your next (or first) consulting client! Post your questions below and I'll get to each one throughout the day!
