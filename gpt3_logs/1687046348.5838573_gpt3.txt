PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

Relying on one company for your income is a huge mistake. 
  
  This applies to a W2 job that's your single source of income or a platform like Upwork that supplies your gigs.  
  
  Upwork can be great in some ways: it matches talent with needs and many freelancers can make solid money from it. 
  
  But they also act as a ruthless dictator in many ways.  
  
  If they decide that you have violated their terms, they don't hesitate to kick you off without warning or even hearing your side of what happened. Often, you don't even know what you did wrong! 
  
  This not only happened to me, but also the writer we've been working with at Mylance.  
  
  He spent years building up a sterling reputation on the platform only for it to be stripped away in the blink of an eye. 
  
  It's time for you as an individual to take ownership of your work. To learn how to find clients and close them without a platform. To build up multiple sources of income so if a company over hires and has to lay you off, you can have a soft landing. 
  
  It's time to take the power back, and own your work. It's the ultimate freedom.

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story. 

SUMMARY: 




==========

RESPONSE:

We all should learn from the harsh experiences of others when it comes to relying on one company for income. Whether you make your living from a W2 job or from freelancing platforms like Upwork, it can be risky to put all your eggs in one basket. Such was the case for me and the writer we had been working with, who was abruptly removed from Upwork without warning or explanation, despite his spotless reputation that he had built up over years. Take control of your work: broaden the search, learn to close deals without a platform, and have multiple sources of income so you can soften any unexpected layoffs. It's time to take the power back and own your work, which is ultimately the ultimate freedom.
