Launching a two-sided on-demand marketplace such as Uber in 2014 was a challenging task, requiring an effectively established driver base so riders could experience a good journey. To build up the driver base Uber ran a number of processes including background checks, iphone delivery to the drivers and also held in-person onboarding events. Promotional activities such as press releases and boots on the ground events also helped to spread the word to potential riders. Finally, to ensure a good experience was provided to riders the driver base was incentivised through hourly guarantees and uber focused attention on key marketplace metrics such as trips requested, trips completed, % Surge & Driver Hourly Earnings. This playbook was followed to launch and scale Uber quickly across hundreds of cities and create a successful two-sided on-demand marketplace.
