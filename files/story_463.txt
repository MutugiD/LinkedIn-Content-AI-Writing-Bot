One of the hardest parts of winning that project, closing that client, or getting that job you want is having the confidence to believe that you can do it.  
  
  Most are of us are either modest or insecure in nature, and that makes it incredibly challenging to pitch yourself to anyone. If you don't believe you can do it, how are they going to pay you for it? 
  
  One thing I do when I'm not sure of myself or what I'm capable of is write down my accomplishments. Maybe it's accomplishments of the year thus far or accomplishments at a company. This exercise forces a more objective view of what I've done and who I've impacted. It's a big confidence boost, and the next time I'm giving an introduction of myself, I'm simply stating facts of things I've accomplished, instead of boasting about myself. 
  
  Try it, you might surprise yourself with how impressive you are!
