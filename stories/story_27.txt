This story is not just for software engineers.  
  
  I consulted in Operations for ~2 years, making 3x my Uber salary in half the number of hours. 
  
  If I can do it, you can do it too. 
  
  Our community of Mylance consultants is full of Operators and Marketers as well all working for themselves, part-time, and more than replacing their previous W2 salaries. 
  
  Thanks Joe Rezendes for sharing your story! I feel privileged to work with you.
