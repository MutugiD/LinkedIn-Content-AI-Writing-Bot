After interviewing a bunch of Mylance members these past few weeks, I keep hearing one thing that sticks out to me: as a professional, you don't want to self-promote on LinkedIn. 
  
  I get it. It's not for everyone. That being said, it's also the best way to tell your network  hey, I'm talented, and I'm open to a consulting gig. 
  
  So most don't ever do it, even though they're secretly wishing they had a side consulting gig that was 10 hours a week bringing in an extra $5k a month.  
  
  Or you wish you could leave your full-time job and consult for 25 hours per week and $20k per month. 
  
  So, what do you do?  
  
  Here's what:  
  
  1. You get a landing page for yourself. You get one that showcases your niche and value-add to a company, and how many hours per week you have available. 
  
  2. You link it in your LinkedIn bio and links, and in your email signature 
  
  3. Your network sees your niche and your availability, and reaches out for an intro call 
  
  In 10 minutes of work, you have told your network  Hey! I'm talented and I can help you! 
  
  Try it. It works.
