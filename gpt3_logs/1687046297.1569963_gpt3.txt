PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

The lowest hanging fruit for your consulting business is obvious, yet very few actually do it: 
  
  
  
  calls with your network.  
  
  Most think this won't go anywhere because there aren't immediate opportunities that come to mind. 
  
  So they don't do it.  
  
  But good things often happen when you get on calls with your network.  
  
  Projects come to life.  
  
  Additional warm introductions happen.  
  
  Collaborations on shared projects. 
  
  Reach out to 10 people in your network to set up catch-up calls. 
  
  Report back when good things happen.

================================
END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story. 

SUMMARY: 




==========

RESPONSE:

Networking is one of the lowest hanging fruits for consulting businesses, yet far too few people actually take advantage of it consistently. By jumping on calls with your network, you open yourself up to a world of benefits, such as potential projects, warm introductions to potential colleagues and clients, and collaborations on shared projects. On top of that, it's a great way to stay in touch with those in your field. To kick-start the process, reach out to 10 people in your network to set up casual catch-up calls. You'll be negatively surprised by the positive results!
