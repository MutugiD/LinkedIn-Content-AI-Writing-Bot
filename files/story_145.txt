Wouldn’t it be nice to get $20k consulting projects handed to you on a silver platter?  
  
  You can position yourself well for this, and never have to do any outbound. Here are two ways. 
  
  (1) First, let your network them know what you're up to so when there is an opportunity, you can be top of mind. 
  
  For me, I let my network know via LinkedIn that I was consulting independently, and got a number of inbounds from old colleagues (some from YEARS ago) reaching out asking if he could help them.  
  
  One ended up being a $20k project for 4 weeks of work! 
  
  (2) Second, we’re going to give our extended network a reason to reach out to us. 
  
  To do this well, update your Linkedin with your accomplishments and a link to your website (or Mylance HQ).  
  
  Once you've done that, share thoughts on your area of expertise in a LinkedIn post.  
  
  This isn't a note on LinkedIn that says HEY I'M CONSULTING LOOK AT ME!  
  
  This is a message sharing your learnings on a topic where you're an expert. 
  
  So many people do not want to do this. They don’t want to self-promote. But it's not self-promotion. You’re not saying how amazing you are.  
  
  You’re sharing something you learned that might be able to help others. Maybe you helped grow Dropbox’s legendary referral program and you want to share your top 5 learnings that other businesses could apply. 
  
  While what you know seems common sense to you, it's not to others, and you might get an incredibly positive response. 
  
  If you don't, no harm no foul, you can either try again or try another method. 
  
  Do this frequently (every day if you're up for it!) you’ll be shocked at how many views you get.  
  
  Some of these views turn into messages and some turn into potential clients.  
  
  Besides 30 minutes of your time, what do you have to lose?
