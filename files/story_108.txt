Three years ago today I incorporated Mylance as a C-Corp based in Delaware.  
  
  I had wanted to start a company that added value to people ever since I can remember. 
  
  And I had started many companies. I'd just never followed through. 
  
  I would get super excited about an idea. Do some research and maybe write up a business plan. I'd buy a domain and get a website live. And then it would get hard. And I'd inevitably stop. It was a repeating cycle that I couldn't shake. 
  
  When I incorporated Mylance, I decided those days were over. That no matter what happened, I was going to see Mylance through to be a success. I didn't know what it would look like. I didn't know how I'd get there. I just knew that every single day I would take one step forward, talk to one more customer, do one more to-do list item, and move the needle. 
  
  It hasn't been easy. It's been incredibly hard. And I've learned so much. But I can sit here today with happy customers, a great team, revenue coming in the door, and (some) money in the bank.  
  
  We're far from where I want to be. But we're on the path. We're in the arena. We're grinding and hustling. And for that, I'm incredibly proud. 
  
  I still don't know exactly how this will end up. Maybe I never will know. But I know that this mentality is what it takes. To never give up no matter how hard it gets. And have full belief in myself and my team that we'll make it happen.  
  
  And I've never had higher conviction in that than I do today.
