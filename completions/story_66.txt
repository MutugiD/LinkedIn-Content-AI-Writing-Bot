We often act in self-sabotaging ways, procrastinating on tasks we need to be doing instead of getting distracted by comfortable or easy activities. To overcome this we need to have clear objectives and strive to make sure our efforts are moving towards our end goals. We should also create a to-do list with our big rocks and must-do items, and tackle those before anything else. It can be scary to do the hard thing, but we can look at that fear and do it anyway.
