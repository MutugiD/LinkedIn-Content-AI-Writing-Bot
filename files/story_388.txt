Getting my start in consulting wasn't an accident. I put myself out there, and ended up with my first client. 
  
  12% of the US Workforce STARTED freelancing since the beginning of COVID. That's almost 20 million people in the US alone. 
  
  With an uncertain growth trajectory for companies, many are taking on consultants to fill gaps as they look to grow. 
  
  By having a niche area of expertise to lend, you can work as a consultant and help these companies scale.  
  
  All our customers at Mylance are doing this, I did it for myself, and you likely can too. 
  
  Not sure how to get started? Shoot me a message and I'm happy to jump on a call to help you!
