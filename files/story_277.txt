I was scared. I had quit my job without anything lined up. I didn't know what was next. And every time someone asked me what I was doing next and I said  I don't know,  that fear just intensified. 
  
  I trusted in my abilities. I had learned and experienced a lot in my career, but I was still scared of the unknown, and of failure. 
  
  I had wanted to be my own boss forever. I was tired of working for someone else, not feeling valued fo my work, and I was sick of the corporate politics.  
  
  So leaving was my only choice. And after I left (and took a few months off) I started to put myself out there. I took my fear, I looked at it, and I put it to the side. It didn't go far away, but I put it far enough to the side that I could take steps forward. It was almost hard to look at my inbox after I'd send a cold email or a proposal.  
  
  Eventually, one hit. And a Series A company agreed to hire me as a part-time contractor for 25 hours per week. And for way more money than my previous full-time salary.  
  
  It changed my worldview.  
  
  I realized I had been underpaid. I wasn't earning my true value. I wasn't working intentionally. 
  
  That all changed, and I've never looked back since.
