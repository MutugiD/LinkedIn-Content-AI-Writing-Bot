How do I get started with my consulting biz? 
  
  First, do not waste your time with these activities: 
  
  1. Designing a logo. 
  2. Making and publishing a beautiful website 
  3. Writing up a business model 
  4. Modeling out your expenses, projections, etc. 
  5. Talking to 1,000 people about their consulting businesses 
  
  These are  feel good  activities that are relatively easy, have no stress or possibility of rejection, and don't move the needle. 
  
  Instead, do these 3 things: 
  
  1. Decide on your niche: where you uniquely add value and the customer to whom you add that value  
  
  2. Reach out to your network (past colleagues and managers) and have 20 conversations 
  
  3. Reach out to 20 companies per month in your niche and talk to as many that will talk to you 
  
  Those are needle-moving activities. And those will result in your first client.
