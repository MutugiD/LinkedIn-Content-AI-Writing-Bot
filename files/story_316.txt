**Exciting announcement** 
  
  Mylance is incredibly excited to welcome Bethany Swartwood as our Head of Tax and Business Legal! 
  
  Bethany comes to us with both a law degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a Chartered Accountant with the Institute of Chartered Accountants.  
  
  Most importantly, she's worked with over 3,500 independent consultants to optimize their business for taxes! She also has over 14 years in the professional services industry, the vast majority within Big 4 firms and most recently worked directly with independent consultants. 
  
  While her credentials are incredible, her passion for this work is undeniable. Below is an excerpt from her letter to our Mylance community: 
  
  I grew up in a home supported by a business of one: my step-father’s construction company. The income he earned from his work put food on our table, kept a roof over our heads, paid our medical bills, and gave us opportunities as children. I would watch my mother, a psychiatric social worker for the County, run around trying to figure out finances, taxes, business law, etc. for my step-dad’s business.  
  
  When times were good, they could try to hire multiple professionals to help; but when times were lean, my mother found the responsibility solely on her shoulders. It drained her, because it wasn’t her calling. But today, it’s mine. 
  
  Our mission here at Mylance is to provide self-employed business owners with the same level of support and security as an employee of a large corporation. You and your business deserve someone in your corner, and we would be honored if you chose Mylance to be that for you.   
  
  -Bethany
