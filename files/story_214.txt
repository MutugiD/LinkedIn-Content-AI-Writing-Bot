Yes, hiring in parts of tech is tough right now. Companies are doing layoffs or freezing hiring. With that said, I know consultants that are crushing it out there.  
  
  Here’s what they’re doing: 
  
  1. They're finding the companies that do need talent, that are growing, that are fundraising, and need to hit their goals. 
  
  2. They're positioning themselves that they bring unique experiences to the table that make them feel invaluable to the company. 
  
  While some companies aren’t in a position to bring on a consultant, many are still growing, raising money, and in need of hitting their goals.  
  
  You do cost extra, but you bring a positive ROI to the table, whether it’s directly from revenue or that you’ll help them get to their next growth milestone so they can raise their next round of funding. 
  
  There’s plenty of work out there. You just have to position yourself well and go after it.
