The launch of Uber Freight back in 2016 was a major success, culminating in a successful $4B valuation just four years later. This was no mean feat, as the Uber Freight business bore no synergies to Uber's core business and required a startup approach within the larger umbrella company. This included user research and conversations with truck drivers to understand needs, an initial reliance on antiquated software as well as carefully managed budgets from Uber itself and a deliberate focus on a single type of freight. Ultimately, it was the hustle and automation of processes that drove the success of Uber Freight and proved that success, even within a larger organisation, is attainable with the right know-how.
