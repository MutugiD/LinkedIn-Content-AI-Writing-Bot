My first consulting client ended up changing my life forever.  
  
  I learned I could work 25 hours per week, make $25k per month, and enjoy the Operations work I was doing adding real value to companies.  
  
  As I learned through trial and error (and many mistakes!), I started to help others with their consulting businesses. 
  
  Over time, this led me to become passionate about flexible, fulfilling work, and start Mylance to support professionals to work for themselves in a part-time and sustainable fashion. 
  
  Since early 2020, Mylance has helped hundreds launch their consulting businesses, including Jeremy Schwartz TJ Blease Sarah Fenn Anyi Weng Jennifer Gerhard Gianni Piccoletti Steven Zhou Henry Carr Alex Conway Irina Tsetsura Andrew Mang Brewa Kennedy Carson Drake Samantha Grassle Albert Budnitskiy, CPA Cherida Smith Jessica (Pawlarczyk) Beckmann Nick Jones Chris Goodmacher Marfa Prokhorova Robbie Taylor Sola Lawal, PhD Kelly Feeney Nick Lisauskas Nick Scherer Patrick Flanagan Jeremy Schwartz Kyle Thomas among many others who have gone on to run incredibly lucrative businesses, replacing their past salaries and then some with part-time work. 
  
  Now, we're challenging you to do the same. Mylance is launching a 2022 Launch Your Consulting Business Contest, with $25,000 in prize money.  
  
  By enrolling in the contest, you'll gain an entry into the Mylance Accelerator - a live, cohort based crash course teaching you everything need to know to launch your consulting business. 
  
  Been thinking about working for yourself or up-leveling your side consulting business? This is the kick in the butt you need.
