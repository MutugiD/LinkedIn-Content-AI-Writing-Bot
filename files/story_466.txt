I know this time can be hard for many, especially for those with kids at home or those who are out of their job. For those that don’t have kids (or those who have kids that are amazing at self-entertaining), this is an incredibly rare time where there’s no FOMO and very few distractions. You’re stuck at home.  
  
  Think of all the things you can do. You can start a blog, read that book you’ve been meaning to, learn a new skill, or 100 other things given this amount of time. This is an incredible opportunity - don’t waste it. 
  
  If I have one productivity tip to share from my time working remotely, it's to set a  must do  list for the next day. If you're lazy as hell, those are the things you're going to accomplish. Write them down, and check them off.
