There's no  typical  consulting project. 
  
  We want there to be, because that would make it easier to define and see what a future project could look like. 
  
  But there isn't. And it's up to you to work with the client to scope out a project that meets their needs that you can deliver on. 
  
  As an example, one of my clients was a super early stage technology company in the logistics space. They had built the technology, but they didn't know how to take it to market.  
  
  So I worked with them in a  strategy  capacity with how to: 
  
  1. Position the product in the market 
  2. Find their first users and get feedback 
  3. Price the product 
  4. Expand past the initial beta phase 
  
  We worked together for a few minutes until they brought me on as their  Chief Strategy Officer  (yes, still part-time). 
  
  I got equity in the company as well as a monthly retainer for the work I was doing. 
  
  Is this  typical?  Probably not. But who cares. I loved the work and I got to work with some incredible founders. 
  
  There's no right way to do things, and that's partially what makes consulting so powerful.
