The honest truth: the starting salary at your new company is your anchor for your lifetime at the company. 
  
  When you're hired as an FTE at a company you negotiate a starting salary.  
  
  You don’t know if you’re being paid well or not.  
  
  And raises are usually percentage increases from that base. Further, your salary doesn’t increase with the value you bring. You could bring in millions for your company, and only get $25,000 as a raise or bonus. 
  
  Once you become a freelance consultant, those days are over.  
  
  As you acquire more experience, skills, and the ability to impact a company, you can charge as much as a client is willing to pay you. 
  
   If you can offer 40% more, you can charge 40% more. No more waiting for someone to promote you or some arbitrary bonus.  
  
  **You charge for the value you bring, period.** 
  
  That is, if you ask for it.
