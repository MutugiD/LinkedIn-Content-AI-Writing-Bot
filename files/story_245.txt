Asking for what you truly want without fear of being told  no  (or knowing you can handle a  no ) is one of the most powerful things you can do to up-level your life and career. 
  
  I didn't know if I could work part-time, but I asked for it, and eventually got it (I got told  no  11 times before I found my first client). 
  
  I also got told  no  146 times when pitching investors. I got 12 yes's and that filled our round. 
  
  Getting told  no  is part of anything that stretches the boundary for you, and is essentially a requirement to get what you truly want.
