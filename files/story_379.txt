As I hire for a few roles for Mylance, I feel compelled to give a few thoughts to candidates looking for a job right now. 
  
  1. Spell names correctly, and don't have spelling or grammar mistakes. A leader is immediately thinking how you'll interface with customers, and if you have errors in your application, that's likely to translate down the road. 
  
  2. Customize your message to the company. Everyone knows a generic message when they see it. If you really want to work for that company, do research and write a compelling note describing why you care about their customers or what problem they're solving.  
  
  3. Make it about the company, not about you. I'm a founder building a company. It might be a great opportunity for you, but that's not the reason I'm going to hire you. I'll hire you because you can help build this business and add value.  
  
  4. Don't lie or make things up. If you don't know the values of the company, don't tell a founder you believe in their values. It's not true, and they'll know it's BS. Be genuine. Be truthful. Be honest. Be yourself.  
  
  If you disagree with any of these, I'd love to hear it in the comments!
