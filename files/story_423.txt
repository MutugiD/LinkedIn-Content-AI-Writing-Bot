For companies, hiring great talent is one of the most challenging aspects of growing a business. 
  
  Often, they're not able to recruit the best person for the job. Or they can, but it takes months to pull it off. 
  
  What about hiring part-time consultants for your business?  
  
  It can be much easier to find an amazing talent with extensive experience for 15-20 hours per week and bring them on as a contractor. Let's look at the benefits: 
  
  1. You actually get that person with amazing experience, where you may not have been able to hire them full-time 
  
  2. You then get to benefit from their experience and their connections 
  
  3. They bring additional credibility to your company 
  
  4. You can flex up or down their involvement as your business fluctuates 
  
  Maybe they're expensive. Maybe they cost $15,000 per month. You bring them on for 3 months to set up a process or get a launch off the ground. That costs you $45k, whereas that person full-time might be $180k per year, plus benefits.  
  
  They not only contribute right away, but their impact is longer lasting as the structure they set up lives on. 
  
  Most companies are always looking for that full-time hire. Why? Are you open to breaking the mold?
