Hiring is arguably the single most function of a company. 
  
  I know this is a tough time to be looking for a job. I'm seeing it from friends, colleagues, and all over Linkedin. 
  
  However, don't just apply to random openings that look good. It's likely a waste of time.  
  
  Here are some tips: 
  
  1. Quality over quantity. Research the company as much as you can. Decide if it's really a good fit and if you think you'd be happy there.  
  
  2. Use their names and spell them correctly.  
  
  3. If they gave you instructions for your application, follow them. It's competitive out there, and hiring managers / recruiters will use anything to help them narrow the list of candidates. 
  
  4. Do something to stand out while not being over the top annoying. Look up the profiles of the founder or hiring manager, and send them a nice note explaining what about the company or role you're excited about, and ask if there's anything else you can do. 
  
  Don't blindly apply to jobs - it's a waste of your time and theirs. Put the time and effort in to make sure A) It's a job you actually want and B) that your application is actually appreciated.
