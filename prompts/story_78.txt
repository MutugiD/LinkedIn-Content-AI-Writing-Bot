I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

I received an inbound message the other day that hit HOME with me. So much so, that I immediately booked a call with him. 
  
  His message hit on a pain I feel.  
  
  To do this well, you HAVE to know: 
  
  1. Your customer attributes (in as much detail as possible) 
  
  2. What situation they are in 
  
  3. Based on that situation, what pain they are feeling 
  
  4. How you solve that pain 
  
  The incredible cold outreach I got nailed this. It was simple, but incredibly effective. I bet he did this work: 
  
  1. His customers are founders who don't have a full-time marketer 
  
  2. Those founders are overwhelmed with the work on their plate, and feel like they have to do all the marketing for their business entirely themselves 
  
  3. The pain is that feeling of overwhelmed, and not wanting to solve it with anything massive, more about leveraging their existing resources more effectively 
  
  4. He will solve it by identifying ONE channel to focus on, taking the marketing off my plate, and leveraging our existing resources 
  
  His note read like this:  
  
  Are you personally managing a lot of the efforts or do you have someone else leading the charge? 
  
  As some quick background on myself, I’m a fractional CMO that works with founders like yourself. My priority is to be surgical with your marketing efforts, and leverage your current resources to maximize your reach. 
  
  I’m also here to remove marketing workload off a busy founder’s shoulders. ;) 
  
  It hit home, and I took a call with him.

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story.
