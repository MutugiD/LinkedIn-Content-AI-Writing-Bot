There is no  right  way to consult.  
  
  With that said, here are 10 tips after building up my own business and helping thousands of others do it: 
  
  1. Network. Take calls. Be open to new conversations. Help others. It will come back to you.  
  
  2. When there's an opportunity, write a kick-ass proposal. Make the leads at the client feel heard in their challenges and very clearly show how you'll add value. 
  
  3. Make it easy to hire you. Find a way to get started. Once you get in the door, knock it out of the park and expand your scope. 
  
  4. Charge for your value, not your time. Never work for free. 
  
  5. Raise your rates. Ask for what you truly want. The worst they can say is  no. 
  
  6. Confront any fears and imposter thoughts head on. We all have it. Overcome it so you can thrive. 
  
  7. Get smart with your LLC. Explore an S-Corp election. Deduct everything you can. You'll save tons of money. 
  
  8. Aim high. You can make 3-4x your W2 consulting. That requires you to say  no  often, and carefully pick how you spend your time. 
  
  9. Have a clearly defined narrow niche, but be ready to adapt to what the client needs.  
  
  10. Design your life how you want. Set your own structure. It doesn't matter what anyone else does, including your past self. You're in charge. Take advantage.
