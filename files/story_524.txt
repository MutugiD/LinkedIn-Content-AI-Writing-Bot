I launched Uber Eats in Miami, FL. When I tell people that, they think it's really cool. Here's what it was really like: 
  
  
  
  1. Pounding the pavement to sell restaurants. We needed to close 100 restaurants in 4 weeks. That takes a lot of calls, meetings, selling, and closing. 
  
  2. Pounding the pavement to attract, train, and onboard couriers. We needed 1,000+ people to deliver food who knew what they were doing. Again, all in 4 weeks. 
  
  3. Developing a grass-roots eater marketing plan. OK this part wasn't hard. Mostly what we did was email 1.5 million riders and tell them we were launching Uber Eats and gave free delivery for 2 weeks. 
  
  4. Testing, testing, and more testing the internal tools system to make sure it worked properly. It still broke the day we launched. 
  
  5. Onboarding, training, and testing restaurants. While we got to sample a lot of food (which was fun), we needed to make sure every restaurant knew what they were doing. And when we launched, we monitored in real-time to make sure restaurants were accepting orders promptly. We'd call the ones that took >5 min to accept an order.  
  
  Sure Uber had plenty of money in the bank, but it didn't matter. Launching new markets took grit, hustle, and tons of pounding the pavement. Very little was automated or scalable, and we worked our tails off to get the job done. 
  
  Whenever I'm working on my business today, I remind myself of the work we did at Uber. It wasn't the most glorious at times, but we hustled, and we got the job done to launch what millions of people use around the world today.
