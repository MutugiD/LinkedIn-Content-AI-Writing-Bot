As an entrepreneur, I'd heard: let the market dictate where to go with your start-up.  
  
  Here's the REAL story of how the Mylance Accelerator came to be: 
  
  When I originally founded Mylance, I started by solving MY biggest challenge as a consultant: bookkeeping and taxes.  
  
  So I found a CPA and launched that as a service (before we built any product). We found a few customers, but time after time during my customer calls I kept hearing  yeah yeah yeah but how do I get bigger deals and formalize my consulting business.   
  
  It kept happening. And finally, mid-conversation with a former Uber colleague I told her that I could help her launch her consulting business and be with her every step of the way. That I had steps set up to walk her through, and would give her feedback to navigate the black box that is consulting. 
  
  In turn, she'd give me a cut of her revenue for 6 months.  
  
  She immediately agreed. I was excited! But, I had fibbed a bit. I didn't actually have this product built out.  
  
  So I got to work, and I built it out as I sent her each module. And it worked. 
  
  And the next customers I spoke with, I told them I had a course to help them launch their consulting businesses. And they were excited. And they were in.  
  
  Fast forward 2.5 years, we've run 15 cohorts across hundreds of people helping them launch their consulting businesses. Some have gone on to build $40k+ / month consulting businesses! It's been challenging and rewarding and everything in between. 
  
  Two things I've heard a million times and actually came true: 
  
  1. Let your customers tell you want problem they want solved, and listen to them 
  
  2. You don't need a product to sell, just a value prop 
  
  The truth is, I never knew this could be a product. It was never an idea on a  business ideas  list and I'm pretty sure if you pitched it to me back then, I wouldn't have believed you
