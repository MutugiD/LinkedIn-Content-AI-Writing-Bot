The first time I negotiated a consulting deal I was nervous and had no idea what I was doing. I was scared of the rejection, or that I'd ask for a number that would get me laughed out of the room. 
  
  It’s natural to be nervous when asking for money. You likely haven’t done it much in your life and there’s always fears around “worth” and rejection. Think about it this way - the worst they can say is “no.” In fact, if you don’t get a “no” at some point in the negotiation, you did something wrong. Why? Well, you left money on the table!  
  
  Ever thought you'd approach something and hope to hear  no?
