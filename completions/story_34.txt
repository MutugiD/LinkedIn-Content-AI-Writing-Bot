Being a successful independent consultant has been a rewarding experience, and it all starts by honing my niche. This is reflected in my ability to explain my experience in such a way that clients understand my value and the tangible results I can bring. My experience with two and three sided B2B and B2C marketplaces through launching UberEATS in Miami and Milan and Uber Freight in the US has been critical in advancing my career.
