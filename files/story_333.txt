Thanks so much to Kevin Mead for sharing his journey from being laid off during COVID to crushing his freelance business. 
  
  Kevin shared a ton of insights with us for how to build a successful consulting business, centered around the power of relationships and trust in the business world.  
  
  In fact, he used his philosophies to hit his monthly freelance consulting goal in 3 days, and now earns 2x his previous salary in 25 hours per week!
