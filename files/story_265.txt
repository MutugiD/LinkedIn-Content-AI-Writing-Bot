Can you start a flexible, part-time consulting business? Of course! Thousands of people are doing it. And there's nothing stopping you.  
  
  Or is there?  
  
  You don't have one right now...  
  
  What's holding you back? 
  
  Do you not know how to present your experience into a well-defined niche? 
  
  Are you worried about putting yourself out there and getting rejected? 
  
  Successful consultants have two main things in common: 
  
  1. They have the confidence to put themselves out there 
  
  2. They've refined their niche to concisely present their value-add to a client 
  
  To do #1, you need to be okay with rejection. You're going to get told  no,  and you need to be okay with that. Many never put themselves out there because of this fear. 
  
  For #2, you need to invest in yourself. You need to spend the time, energy, and money to get this right. This could mean getting advice from a friend, but to really get it right, you likely need a coach to help you nail this down and differentiate your offering.  
  
  The brutally honest truth is the only person that's holding you back is you.  
  
  If you really want to work flexibly and be your own boss, you have to be willing to put in the work, invest in yourself, and go get it. Nobody is going to hand it to you.  
  
  Are you willing to do what it takes to get what you want?
