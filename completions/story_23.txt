When Uber and Lyft both launched UberX in Raleigh, Uber had a vision to provide a fast and reliable service to their customers, and executed it masterfully. Through the launch of their services in a small 7 mile circle, working hard to ensure ETAs were under 5 minutes, targeted incentives to existing drivers, and local city teams dedicated to the Raleigh-Durham area, Uber was able to secure a 90%+ market share over the course of 6 months. This story serves as a lesson that success is not only determined by being first, but by focusing on the most important activities, having fast reactions in market, and understanding local demand.
