As our June bootcamp at Mylance is winding down, our customers have either found their first clients, or are in late stage negotiations, and we couldn't be more excited for them to launch their freelance lives. 
  
  As we take in the feedback, we're elaborating on our current offering by: 
  
  1. Having professional coaches in 3 different areas: Personal Branding, Executive Coaching, and Proposal Writing 
  2. More collaboration within the cohort for accountability and peer feedback 
  3. Additional expert sessions with our CPA and lawyers to make sure your freelance businesses are set up properly 
  
  Further, they're a part of the Mylance community forever, helping them connect with other talented freelancers and get access to high paying gigs. 
  
  For our bootcamp customers, we cover everything to help them skip 9 months of research and trial and error in launching their freelance businesses. 
  
  This includes honing your specific niche, setting up your business up properly with our CPAs and lawyers, creating your proposal that you'll send to clients, crafting your verbal pitch, setting your rate, scoping out projects, and where and how to find and close clients. 
  
  I'm incredibly excited to bring the freelance life to more and more people!
