I quit my full-time job in October 2018, and never looked back. Here are 7 different ways I've made money since then: 
  
  1. I bought a tiny ecommerce business, automated the backend, realized I didn't like selling wine openers and sold the business for 4x 
  
  2. I consulted part-time, monetizing my Uber experience for ~$20k / month in 25 hours per week 
  
  3. I sold an  intro to Crypto  investment guide as a course on Gumroad 
  
  4. I made some recruiting placements using my network to make 10% of their first year salary 
  
  5. I helped an early stage company go to market and get sold, getting a small cut of the transaction 
  
  6. I took the money I was making from consulting in 2019 to buy crypto when it was down 90%  
  
  7. I helped tech professionals launch their consulting business (this is how Mylance started), selling a Bootcamp for $1249 that was run using Slack, Zoom, and Google sheets 
  
  Note: I also tried about 50 other things that didn't work at all (travel company, blog, video content, selling a different course). Not everything I did worked, and that's okay. It's part of the process. 
  
  The future of work is diversified income across monetizing experiences and skills (consulting), content (courses, podcasts, nfts), and passive investments (physical real estate, crypto, and metaverse). 
  
  The easiest one to start is consulting. YOU are the product. Your network are your customers. All it takes is a few emails and you're likely to find your first client. What are you waiting for?
