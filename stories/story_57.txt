You're good at things you've never tried. 
  
  You just don't know it yet. 
  
  We all have this fear inside our heads. It's a fear of the unknown. We make up a story about how we won't be great at it, and so we don't even try it. 
  
  I had never done  sales  before. I'm introverted, so it always felt so unnatural to me and I never even wanted to try it. 
  
  When I started consulting, I had to do some sales. I had to close clients for myself. 
  
  Sales  has such a negative connotation in my mind. 
  
  But in practice, I actually loved closing clients. 
  
  Closing clients, in practice, meant having conversations with interesting business leaders, being curious about their business and their challenges, and sharing my experiences. It meant finding an opportunity where my expertise was valuable to them. 
  
  And it turns out, I was pretty damn good at it! It wasn't stressful. It wasn't painful. It was fun! 
  
  What is something that you're not doing because you're scared you might not be good at it?
