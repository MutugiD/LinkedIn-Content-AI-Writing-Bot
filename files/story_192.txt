Charging hourly has almost all cons. 
  
  1. Your incentives are misaligned with your client. You want to work more to get paid more, and they’re worried about giving you too much work, worried about racking up their own bill 
  
  2. You have to keep a timesheet, and that’s not fun for anyone 
  
  3. You don’t know reliably how much you’ll get paid, and they don’t know how much they’ll be outlaying each month 
  
  4. You encourage the mindset of “oh I can get the nicer TV, and just work two extra hours” 
  
  5. You’re inclined to take longer to do things than the task requires, which isn’t good for you or your client 
  
  Unless it’s a last resort, we never recommend an hourly arrangement for your consulting gigs #consultingtips
