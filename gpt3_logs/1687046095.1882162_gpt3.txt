PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

You're good at things you've never tried. 
  
  You just don't know it yet. 
  
  We all have this fear inside our heads. It's a fear of the unknown. We make up a story about how we won't be great at it, and so we don't even try it. 
  
  I had never done  sales  before. I'm introverted, so it always felt so unnatural to me and I never even wanted to try it. 
  
  When I started consulting, I had to do some sales. I had to close clients for myself. 
  
  Sales  has such a negative connotation in my mind. 
  
  But in practice, I actually loved closing clients. 
  
  Closing clients, in practice, meant having conversations with interesting business leaders, being curious about their business and their challenges, and sharing my experiences. It meant finding an opportunity where my expertise was valuable to them. 
  
  And it turns out, I was pretty damn good at it! It wasn't stressful. It wasn't painful. It was fun! 
  
  What is something that you're not doing because you're scared you might not be good at it?

================================
END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story. 

SUMMARY: 




==========

RESPONSE:

The story tells of how even those who are naturally introverted can succeed in sales. It shares how one overcame an irrational fear of the unknown and discovered they could close clients with ease and joy. The takeaway is that anyone can be successful at a task they have never tried before, but only if they take that leap of faith and give it a go.
