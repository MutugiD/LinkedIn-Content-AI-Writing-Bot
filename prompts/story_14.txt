STORY:
================================

What launching a city for Uber looked like in 2014: 
  
  To launch a two-sided on-demand marketplace, the biggest challenge was building up supply (in this case, drivers) so demand needs (rider requests) could be met with a good experience.  
  
  For Uber, this meant we needed a concentration of drivers online to accept requests on the road so riders would have a good experience.  
  
  To build up the driver base to launch a new city, Uber would: 
  
  1. Attract driver sign-ups mostly through ads (Craigslist, Indeed) and a referral program 
  
  2. Run every driver through a background check and get their documents reviewed: license, registration, and insurance 
  
  3. Once approved, Uber didn't have the ability to let drivers download the app on their phone. So we needed to give an iPhone to every single driver and teach them how to use the app. To do this we held both in-person  onboarding  events and eventually built a delivery process to ship phones. We'd (usually) take a deposit for the phone with the hopes of getting it back. 
  
  The rider side was a bit easier. We'd work hard to get press, and do a number of  boots on the ground  events to spread the word. 
  
  I personally went to UNC's orientation in Chapel Hill for the Chapel Hill launch. We tried to sign up every new student onto Uber and were frequently met with  I'm not giving my credit card info, I'll just take a cab!  Funny now looking back. 
  
  When the launch was ready to go live, we'd launch in a small geography to ensure 5-min ETAs. It was better to serve a small number of customers really well than widen the geo with a sub-par experience. 
  
  To ensure riders had a good experience, we'd incentivize drivers to stay online through hourly guarantees in a certain geo and accept rider trips. 
  
  After the launch, we were hyper focused on our marketplace metrics to see how well demand was being met, and if drivers were earning enough. The top three marketplace metrics: 
  
  1. Rides Completed / Rides Requested 
  2. % of trips surged 
  3. Driver hourly earnings 
  
  While Uber was far from perfect, we found a way to launch in hundreds of new cities across a few years, following this playbook to scale the local marketplaces quickly!

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story.
