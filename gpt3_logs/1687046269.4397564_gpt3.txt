PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

Is it harder to get a consulting gig now than it was a year or two ago? 
  
  I get this question A LOT from our community. 
  
  And the short answer is, yes. It's harder. Fewer companies are hiring and more experts want to consult.  
  
  But, it's far from impossible. I know thousands of consultants that are not only crushing it, but they're also turning down work because they are in such high demand. 
  
  What makes them successful? 
  
  1. A very clear niche and value-add 
  2. Strong network 
  3. Continuing to build that network through weekly calls and meet-ups 
  4. Delivering high-value client work that leads to referrals 
  
  It's harder than it was, but it's far from impossible. 
  
  Anyone that says it's impossible is making excuses for their lack of success.  
  
  It's harsh but true. 
  
  If you want it, it's out there. You just need to go get it.

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story. 

SUMMARY: 




==========

RESPONSE:

It has become more challenging to get a consulting gig over the past few years - with fewer companies hiring and more experts vying for the same positions. Despite this, thousands of consultants are succeeding and even turning down work due to their high demand. To stand out, consultants need to create a niche and value-add, build a strong network, maintain connections, and provide outstanding client work. It may seem difficult, but with dedication, it is possible to make it as a consultant.
