I had crazy imposter syndrome when I left Uber and started consulting for myself. Here's what it was like: 
  
  I was used to having a company behind me. I always wanted to perform well in my job, but I had a stable salary, I had supportive coworkers (mostly), and a strong sense of stability. 
  
  Leaving that felt a shattering. All of a sudden the only thing behind me was myself. I was responsible for everything: my structure, finding business, and delivering on what I said I would. 
  
  Here are 3 main things I did to manage it: 
  
  1. I hired a coach. All the top professionals in the world have a coach. I figured if I wanted to crush it, I'd get one too. It wasn't cheap. I spent over $8,000 the first time. It felt like a lot. In retrospect, it was one of the best investments I've ever made and easily paid for itself. It changed my life forever and I'm proud of myself for making that bet. 
  
  2. I outlined a daily and weekly structure for myself. I scheduled meetings for myself. I scheduled time off (much more fun than the meetings). I set aside specific times for specific tasks. I blocked off no-meeting heads down time. I made up a morning routine. I wasn't perfect with this routine, but the structure when I left corporate was incredibly helpful. 
  
  3. I wrote down my accomplishments. This may feel silly, but I somewhat lost sight of what  good  looked like. Without feedback or a manager, I didn't know how I was doing. So I set goals and wrote down my accomplishments. This helped me feel like I was doing  good  when I was only working 25 hours per week. 
  
  Over time, I gained confidence and could show up much better for my scoping calls and my clients. But it never fully goes away - it's something I practice each and every day, even as a founder now with a team. 
  
  Thinking of going out on your own? It's an exciting life full of flexibility and empowerment. But it's also tough at times, and important to set yourself up for success!
