Today is my 3 year anniversary of starting Mylance. 
  
  3 years ago today I had an idea. That idea was to create a platform to power independent consultants. 
  
  I didn’t know what it would look like. I didn’t know how to get started. I had tried and failed to start a company many times before. What would make this time different? 
  
  I knew I need to “just get started” and put one foot in front of the other. 
  
  I also knew I needed the mindset that no matter what happened, I was going to make it a success. The only failure would be giving up. I had complete power over that, and it wasn’t going to happen. 
  
  So, I got started. I did one thing to push the business forward every day. And it was HARD. At the beginning with no customers, feedback, or partners, I lacked motivation at times. I struggled. But I kept going.  
  
  I planned my next step the night before and when I woke up, I knocked it out. And I got small wins. Like really small: choosing a name, buying a domain, launching our first website and eventually a bigger one: landing our first customer. 
  
  I kept a note of my wins (big and small) and referenced it when the going got tough. 
  
  Fast forward 3 years and I have a team, customers, real revenue, growth, and most importantly, our company has helped hundreds of professionals work for themselves as consultants.  
  
  It’s a mission that’s building towards the future of work. It’s one I’m passionate about. And it’s one I wake up every day excited to build towards. #onwards
