Struggling with imposter thoughts is common among many customers, and I use specific strategies to overcome them. I list out my accomplishments to remind myself of the successes I achieved, and I write down my biggest goals for the short and long term. In addition, I jot down my worst case scenarios as a reminder that nothing is as bad as it may seem. I also journal to release the thoughts in my head and surround myself with others with similar aspirations to remind myself that making mistakes is part of the process, and never to give up on my dreams.
