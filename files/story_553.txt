Back when Travis was CEO, Uber incentivized a few hundred of its employees to work over the Christmas / NYE Holiday.  
  
  It resulted in new business ideas, a strong loyalty to the company, and supported the city teams on the busiest night of the year.  
  
  Here's what went down: 
  
  1. They called it  Workation.  Uber would send out details a few weeks in advance where employees could pitch an idea for the business. 
  
  2. The top 100 ideas were selected, and the employees who submitted those ideas became project leads.  
  
  3. Over the next 2 weeks, project leads would assemble a team to support them in building their idea (with the goal to have a working prototype by the end). 
  
  4. The deal was: project leads got flights and $100 / day covered to anywhere in the world. Anyone on the project team got $100 / day, but had to pay for their own flight. 
  
  5. Teams spread across the globe from Dec 26 - Jan 5th to work on their projects, again with the idea of building a working prototype. 
  
  6. Given New Year's Eve is Uber's biggest day of the year, city team members were tasked with being  on call  to support in case anything broke. And something always broke. 
  
  7. After the Workation sprint, projects were submitted to HQ, which were evaluated on business impact and completeness, and winners were chosen. 
  
  A few Workation projects even made it into the app as features that still exist today! But more importantly, it built a sense of camaraderie with fellow employees that you might never meet otherwise. 
  
  Important to note that Workation was 100% optional and nothing was held against you if you didn't go. 
  
  Curious given the working environment today: what are your thoughts on this kind of project within a company?
