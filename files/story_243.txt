I was vulnerable with my team earlier today, and I'm going to be vulnerable here with all of you. 
  
  The founder journey is a hard one. Anyone who says otherwise is lying. There are big ups and huge downs.  
  
  For me, there's strength in vulnerability. In acknowledging when it's hard, and knowing I have what it takes to press onwards no matter what's thrown at me. 
  
  We might have a down month. We might get told  no  a number of times. But the only failure would be to give up. And there's no way in hell I'm ever giving up.
