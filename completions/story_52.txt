I use aText, an app costing $4.99 that replaces shortcuts of words with longer text, to save tons of time every week. It's used for repetition, such as zoom links, various Calendly links, signatures and landing page links, as well as longer copy and conversations. The syncing with my Mac saves even more time. It's a game-changer!
