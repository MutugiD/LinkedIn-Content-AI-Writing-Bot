“I want to grow my consulting business but I’m just too busy.” 
  
  We have tons of commitments every day: people are asking us for things. Everyone wants to talk to us. We committed to a client and it’s taking up a ton of time. Our families need quality time. Our pets need walks and love. And we have a job to do or a business to run.  
  
  It’s not a lack of hours in the day. There’s plenty of time in the day.  
  
  ✨It’s a matter of what we choose to fill the hours with. Everything is a choice.✨ 
  
  We make time for the things that are important to us. And if we’re not incredibly careful with our time and exercise our boundaries, we’ll get lost in what everyone else wants from us. 
  
  🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️ But what about you? Who’s going to prioritize you? Other people certainly are not. But they’ll take what you give them. And then ask for more.🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️ 
  
  Only you can carve out time for you. And say “no” to that friend who could really use your help, but it doesn’t move you close to your goals. Or stop working with that client that’s just not paying you very much, or is not treating you well. 
  
  It’s up to you to set that boundary, prioritize yourself, and move you closer to your own goals.
