When starting a company, I find it challenging to know what  success  is at this early stage. How do you know you're doing the right thing or on the right track?  
  
  I have metrics I track and at the end of the day it's about customers and revenue, but I still wonder if what I'm doing is setting up the business for scale and longevity. It feels like I'm one move away from making business-ending mistake.  
  
  How do other entrepreneurs think about this so they can remain confident in the path they're headed down?
