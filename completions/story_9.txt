When I left Uber, I knew I wanted to pursue something on my own. I had an appetite for experimentation, but I needed to ensure I had a steady stream of income. I started responding to recruiters on LinkedIn, letting them know I was available for part-time roles. 

The response I received was a mixed bag. 11 companies either didn't respond or told me no. But I kept pushing and eventually I found one company that said yes. That ended up being my first client and the start of my freelance consulting career. 

No matter how many rejections you receive, keep pushing. Rejection is part of the process for anyone who wants to try something new. Don't be afraid to ask for more or push harder. There's nothing wrong with finding a "no" before a "yes".
