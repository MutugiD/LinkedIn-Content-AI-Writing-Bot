People will pay you for your expertise. 
  
  Here's how to do it: 
  
  
  1. Write an article about an experience and learning you had in a professional endeavor (job or consulting project). The more detailed and insightful, the better 
  
  2. Post said article on LinkedIn and Medium. Make a Twitter thread out of it (I use Chirr to easily make Twitter threads) 
  
  3. Have offers ready to go (e.g., I charge $500 / hr to allow you to pick my brain on the topic, or I charged $5500 / month for part-time ongoing advisory services) 
  
  If you execute on those, post one article per week for the next month, I nearly guarantee you will get some inbound. 
  
  It works. You just have to put in the effort.
