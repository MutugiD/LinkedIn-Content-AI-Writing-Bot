Do you need an LLC for your consulting business? 
  
  You don’t NEED one, but we recommend one for your freelance business.  
  
  Why? As an independent consultant, you’re now running your own business. You’re contracting with companies, and while you can do that as an individual, if something were to go wrong and aren't working under your LLC, you would personally be liable. 
  
  If you form an LLC and use that LLC to contract with the company, when set-up correctly, the LLC protects you personally.  
  
  After all, the United States is the most litigious country in the world, so it’s to your benefit to keep your personal assets separate from your business assets.  
  
  An LLC will protect your personal assets, limiting creditors or anyone filling a lawsuit, in most cases, to only collect from your business assets. 
  
  Further, in certain situations you can choose to have your LLC taxed as an S-Corp and save tens of thousands of dollars in taxes when done right.  
  
  Talk to an accounting professional to do the calculation to see if the S-Corp election makes sense for you!
