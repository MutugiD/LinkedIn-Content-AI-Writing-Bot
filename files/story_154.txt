I always want more. It feels like I'm constantly not  there. 
  
  I founded Mylance three years ago.  
  
  And as an ambitious professional, I'm constantly striving for bigger, better, faster. I want to help millions of people, grow a multi-million dollar, profitable company. 
  
  But it doesn't happen overnight. 
  
  It takes years of hard work, smart work, perseverance, dedication, and a bunch of other gritty adjectives.  
  
  And I can't just WILL the outcome. I have to focus on the process, and celebrate incremental gains. 
  
  And when I write my updates now and share that we're at a $600k annualized revenue run rate, I'm trying to shift my perspective and be really proud of the progress we've made (8x in 1 year!) vs. being down that we're not bigger, better, faster.
