When I left Uber, I went through my LinkedIn inbound messages and responded that I wasn't open to full-time jobs, but I would be open to helping part-time as a consultant.  
  
  It was a shot in the dark. I had no idea if this was possible for someone like me. 
  
  I responded to 12 companies. 11 said  no  or didn't respond. 1 responded favorably, and asked to talk further. 
  
  That one company who did respond ended up being my first consulting client.  
  
  You're not going to shoot 100%. Or even 50%. But if you put yourself out there enough times, you're going to eventually find success. 
  
  I didn't know what was possible until I asked for it. And turns out not only was it possible, but it would change my life forever. 
  
  What do you have to lose? The bigger loss is not ever trying.
