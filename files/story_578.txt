 How do I package all my experiences so I can have an offer to consult? 
  
  You want $20k per month consulting? We need to nail this.  
  
  And it's the most common question I get from our customers. 
  
  So, let's break it down. 
  
  Our goal is to get hired by a company, just get hired part-time. 
  
  To do this, we need to 
  1. Differentiate ourselves 
  2. Clearly communicate what we bring to the table 
  3. Do #1 and #2 confidently. 
  
  Ideal customer 
  To do that well, I need to nail down my ideal client: who can I add an incredible amount of value to based on my experience? 
  
  The value I bring 
  Then, I can answer the question: what can I help them with? What problems can I solve for them that will help them achieve their goals? 
  
  Past experiences as validation 
  Based on my past experiences, how can I validate the value I wrote above? 
  
  This can look like the following: 
  1. My ideal customer is a Seed stage, marketplace start-up likely in food delivery or ride-sharing 
  
  2. I specialize in launching and scaling new markets including supply and demand side acquisition and marketplace dynamics 
  
  3. Given my experience launching Uber Eats in Miami and Milan, and Uber Freight in the US and growing it to a $1B valuation in 2 years 
  
  Ideal customer + value add + validation = success 
  
  And once you do these exercises and feel good about them, you'll be a hell of a lot more confident going into a client.
