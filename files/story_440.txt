In starting a company, you're not always going to get things right. 
  
  I learned this week that we had misaligned expectations with a customer, and we didn't deliver how we intended. It's always hard to hear customer feedback, and especially when it's your company.  
  
  After taking it hard at first, I started to process it, lean into it, learn from it, and make it right. There were two actions that came out of this: 
  
  1. How do we make our product that much better given the feedback from this customer?  
  2. How do I make it right with that unsatisfied customer? 
  
  I'm happy to say we've acted on the feedback, and I reached out personally to that customer to find a resolution that we're both happy with. To the point that he said he'd consider investing in our company! 
  
  As they say, it's most important how you react to your mistakes, not that you made them in the first place.
