In 2019 as I built up my own consulting business, I was using my free time to explore business ideas. I'd always wanted to start my own company. 
  
  When I came up with the idea for Mylance, I knew it was right. 
  
  I felt it was right deep down.  
  
  I didn't know exactly what it would turn into, but I knew I had an incredibly large market combined with a problem I was passionate about. 
  
  Fast forward 3 years and I have a business! I have an amazing team, we help ambitious customers, we've built incredible software and helped hundreds of people. 
  
  It's also the hardest thing I've ever done. It's a grind and a rollercoaster. Some days are great and others are extremely difficult. 
  
  I've worked hard to embrace the journey. Of building up the team, raising money, building product, interacting with our customers, and finding product market fit. 
  
  It's hard. It's rewarding. It's stressful. It's fulfilling. 
  
  And I will tell you I couldn't imagine doing ANYTHING else. 
  
  I hope as you reflect this holiday season, you look back at what you've done over the past few years and you look back proudly. If even just to acknowledge the journey you're on, and that you're giving it your best.
