Finding a consulting client doesn't have to be a chore. I had success by focussing on the expertise I had to offer and the problems I could come in and help the client solve. By treating the situation like the clients were lucky to have me, I was able to take the pressure off of the sales aspect and focus on the issues at hand, having curious discussions to understand the client's current state and where they wanted to go. This resulted in utilizing my experience to provide helpful and valuable insights.
