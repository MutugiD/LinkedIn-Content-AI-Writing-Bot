I was in meetings all day every day with no time to do my actual  work.  Sound like your life? 
  
  That all ended for me when I started consulting. Sure I had to jump on calls here and there, but I was no longer in meetings all day. 
  
  I had command of my schedule and the scope of my projects. I could choose exactly the parts of my role I loved, and remove from the scope anything I didn't love. 
  
  As an example, for one of my clients I led the launch of a food delivery marketplace. I taught them how to pitch and onboard restaurants. I helped them with eater promotions and marketing. I helped them with the pricing for their cars and how to balance the marketplace dynamics. I told them who to hire, how to vet and interview, and how to set up the org structure. I set up a customer support infrastructure for them. 
  
  I told them explicitly I would not be responding to restaurant inquiries or answer eater emails. I was not on-call for urgent matters. I did not sit in meetings all day.  
  
  I advised and executed on the parts I enjoyed the most. 
  
  And I got paid WAY more than my Uber salary, for less time. And more enjoyable time! 
  
  Believe it or not, there is a way to construct your work life in a way that you love and isn't consumed by meetings.  
  
  It starts with honing your niche, identifying your ideal client, and putting yourself out there. 
  
  And that's why we built Mylance.
