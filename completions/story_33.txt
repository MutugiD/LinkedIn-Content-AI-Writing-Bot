I am an experienced professional that specializes in building high-quality web applications quickly and efficiently - in as little as two weeks. My ideal clients are pre-product start-ups with non-technical founders that have done some fundraising and need to bring their first product to life. I have a wide range of experience, including helping an early-stage YCombinator startup build and launch their product from the ground up, founding and successfully selling my own B2B tech startup, and developing the Touchless Loads feature at Uber that now saves the company over $9 million a year. I'm dedicated, experienced, and ready to help turn your idea into a reality.
