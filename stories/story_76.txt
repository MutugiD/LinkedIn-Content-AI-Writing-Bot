Behind every successful consulting project is a compelling proposal that legitimizes you, showcases your value, and clearly outlines how you'll help the client.  
  
  How do you put this in writing? 
  
  Your proposal should be a one-pager with 4 sections:  
  
  1 . About you: your experience, accomplishments, and education  
  
  2. Top priorities for the company (you will find this out on your intro call)  
  
  3. Initial projects to execute for the company (based on their priorities - you will find this out on your intro call)  
  
  4. Logistics (compensation, travel, on-site time, etc.)  
  
  Anything you'd add?
