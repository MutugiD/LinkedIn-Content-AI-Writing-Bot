Idea for those interesting in starting a business or joining an early stage business, especially given we're all stuck at home: 
  
  Learn to build prototypes using no-code tools! 
  
  If you have a business idea, you can test it with no product or code. And even once you have tested it, you can build it with no-code tools before you raise money or hire expensive engineers. 
  
  We learned a ton about no-code tools today at On Deck: 
  -Makerpad 
  -Landbot 
  -Tray.io 
  -Stacker 
  -Webflow 
  
  and many more. Know more no-code tools? Have experience building with them? Share your thoughts below!
