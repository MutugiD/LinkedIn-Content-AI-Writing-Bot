I'm saying  no  a lot more these days.  
  
  It's hard. I don't want to say  no  to people asking for my help.  
  
  But I also know I need to prioritize incredibly well if I want my business to be a success long term. 
  
  Unfortunately, that requires eliminating as many distractions as possible and focusing entirely on my customers, my team, and the market. 
  
  It hurts a lot. It doesn't feel good. I wish I could jump on calls with students or talk with other entrepreneurs asking for help. But I know every minute spent with someone else, is a minute not spent on my own work.  
  
  If I'm not going to prioritize myself, who will? 
  
  How do you think about this balance between helping others and focusing on your own work?
