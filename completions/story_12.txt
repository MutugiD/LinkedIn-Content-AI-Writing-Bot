Starting out as a consultant, I learned that it is important to package your skillset to potential clients so they understand what you can do for them. Having a well-defined niche is instrumental to success in this regard. That's why the first exercise in the Mylance Bootcamp helps customers hone in and frame their experience in a way that speaks to a client's needs and challenges. Doing this can make all the difference in closing a consulting deal worth five figures a month.
