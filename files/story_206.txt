My experience is the opposite. VC backed Seed and Series A start-ups have aggressive goals they need to hit, and thus are open to paying the right experts great money to help them avoid mistakes and give a better chance to hit those milestones.  
  
  They have money, many have PMF, and they're trying to scale quickly. Experts (consultants!) help that a lot. 
  
  I made ~$25k / month for over 2 years with no shortage of clients working with start-ups. I highly recommend it!
