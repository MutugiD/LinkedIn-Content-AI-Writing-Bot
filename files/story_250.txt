Asking for money is scary. We’re not used to it and the potential to get told “no” brings up fears of failure.  
  
  But, to get the rates we want, we have to be willing to ask for it. And we actually seek a “no” - that’s how we know we asked high enough.  
  
  If they say yes immediately, we by definition could’ve gotten more.  
  
  Get used to being uncomfortable and pushing the boundaries. You’re much more likely to accomplish your goals.
