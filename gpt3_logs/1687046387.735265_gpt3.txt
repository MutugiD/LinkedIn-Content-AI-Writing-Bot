PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

The biggest move I ever made to up-level my career: I quit my job.  
  
  I loved being at Uber. But when I was there, I was wrapped up in it, making me completely blinded to the other opportunities outside the company. 
  
  Once I quit, I explored a ton and opened my eyes up to one simple fact: there are a ton of different ways to make money: 
  
  -I bought a tiny ecommerce business and sold online 
  -I made a few placements from my network at tech companies 
  -I started a blog 
  -I consulted 
  -I sold courses on how to consult 
  -I eventually started my own software company 
  
  I learned new skills. Met a ton of great people. And eventually got to where I'd always wanted: running my own business.  
  
  AND I used the money I was making from consulting to fund my life while I started my own company.  
  
  I never knew any of this was possible. And the only way I could find out was to quit, and explore.  
  
  It was scary, but I believed in myself. And very quickly I saw that I'd be just fine on my own.

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story. 

SUMMARY: 




==========

RESPONSE:

After two years at Uber, I realized that I was missing out on potential opportunities and decided to take a leap of faith and quit my job. I then ventured into a myriad of ventures ranging from e-commerce, tech placements, blogging, consulting, and eventually starting my own software company. As I progressed, I gained valuable skills and made lifelong connections along the way. Ultimately, I was able to achieve my end goal of running my own successful business and used the money from consulting to fund my endeavors. Despite it being a scary move, I pushed through and proved to myself that I was capable of succeeding on my own.
