Uber's team was focused on hitting 5 minutes ETAs in a small geography while Lyft was focused on covering the entire area. Uber quickly ramped up their supply and earned the trust of the riders in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area with their detailed marketing strategies, targeted incentives for existing drivers, and local city teams. The result was that Uber had >90% market share 6 months after launch. It teaches us an important lesson - that to win, you don't have to be first, but be focused on the things that matter most.
