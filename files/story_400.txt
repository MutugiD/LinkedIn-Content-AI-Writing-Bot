No doubt it’s been a hard year. But I’m incredibly grateful.  
  
  I’m grateful I get to work for myself.  
  I’m grateful for the customers I’ve been able to impact.  
  I’ve grateful for the team around me at Mylance helping to change peoples’ lives.  
  I’m grateful for my family and friends.  
  I’m grateful for what the LinkedIn community has provided.  
  
  I get fulfillment out of helping others, and we’ve helped dozens of talented professionals who got laid off or just wanted to work for themselves make the jump and land on their feet.  
  
  Here’s to many more through the end of this year and in 2021!
