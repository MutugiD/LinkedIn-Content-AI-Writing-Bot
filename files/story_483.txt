My first consulting project after leaving my full-time role was incredibly lucrative ($25k / month). At the time I felt lucky as hell. Looking back, here are the 6 things that made it happen: 
  
  1. My experience matched perfectly with their needs. I had launched Uber Eats in two markets, and they were launching a food delivery marketplace from scratch. I fit their need incredibly well. 
  
  2. I validated my experience. I pointed to clear, high value experiences that in their mind validated me, and through my proposal and conversations, convinced them I could solve their problem. 
  
  3. I (somehow) went in very confident. I had no idea what to charge or how to put together a good proposal, but I did my best with the proposal and threw out a very high rate (I started with $287 / hr). I didn't NEED this work, so figured I had nothing to lose by throwing out a high number.  
  
  4. I didn't negotiate against myself. When they said my number was too high, I asked them to counter. They countered with $250 / hr. And we made the deal. 
  
  5. I asked if they were open to part-time. They wanted a full-time person. I told them honestly that I wasn't up for that, but that I could solve their problems part-time. They eventually agreed once I convinced them my experience was relevant. It wasn't about the number of hours, it was about whether I could solve the problem or not. 
  
  6. They had an ability to pay given they were a Series A, well-funded venture backed company. 
  
  I knew zero then compared to what I know now, and I made a lot of mistakes. But asking for what I wanted and properly validating myself played a huge role, and got me a great first consulting project that set me off on an incredible path.
