I feel so rude saying  no  to folks asking for a coffee chat to catch up. Here's what I'm doing instead: 
  
  
  
  I recently started being completely honest that my calendar is absolutely crazy right now and I have to prioritize my own business. 
  
  After all, who doesn't understand that? 
  
  However, I do want to be helpful. So I tell them to ask their question or share their thought and I can thoughtfully respond in the chat. 
  
  It's not the same, but it's some small way I can help folks in my network. 
  
  What do you do? Do you ignore? Take every call? Tell them you're busy? Comment below your tips!
