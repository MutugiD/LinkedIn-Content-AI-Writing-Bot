Lots who never thought they could get laid off did over the past few years.  
  
  Maybe you're one of them.  
  
  If not, you likely know a friend who did. 
  
  Layoffs suck. But they're a part of doing business. Companies hire for growth and if they experience a slow down, they have to cut costs. It's not personal to you. It's just business.  
  
  And this is exactly how you should think about your job. It's a job. It's business. You don't owe your company anything. And when things get tough, they won't think twice about cutting your job.  
  
  That's why it's wise to build up additional income streams. Don't rely on a company that isn't loyal to you.  
  
  Diversify your income. Work across a number of companies. Put your expertise to great use. 
  
  It's fun. 
  
  It brings in extra money. 
  
  And it brings real security so if you were to get laid off or fired, you'll have an incredibly soft landing.
