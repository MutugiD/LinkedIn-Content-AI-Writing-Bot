 If consulting was so lucrative, why'd you stop to build a company? 
  
  It's a question I get a lot. Here's my answer: 
  
  I've always had an entrepreneurial drive. I started and failed to build a company nearly a dozen times over the years. 
  
  When I left Uber, I left to build something on my own. Consulting for me was a bridge while I figured out what I wanted to build. And it was an amazing bridge: I learned a ton, I made great money, and I got to work with awesome people.  
  
  But the most important outcome was a new passion. A passion for part-time, flexible work where you can work for yourself, on your own time, make great money, and enjoy the work you're doing. 
  
  As I lived more in this world, I fell in love with it more. And I realized I had the perfect combination of passion and expertise in one topic. 
  
  And so I decided it was time to build, combining that passion and expertise, solving my own problems and being my own customer. 
  
  That's why I left consulting to start Mylance. I've always been a builder, and now I get the opportunity to build in a problem space I love, being fulfilled by helping amazing professionals grow their consulting businesses every single day.
