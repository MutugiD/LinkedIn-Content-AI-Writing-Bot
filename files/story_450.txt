Maybe the Linkedin community can help me out. 
  
  Of all the people I've talked to about our consulting bootcamp, 94% of them have been male. While there's nothing specifically wrong with that, I want to not only have a diverse Mylance community, I also want our material to be accessible for everybody. 
  
  That is why I've started Mylance - to enable the independent consulting life for everyone. And right now I'm leaving out 50% of the population.  
  
  Help! How do I attract a more diverse group, and make our offering approachable to both genders?
