I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

As I work to grow Mylance, I hired a coach to help me navigate product market fit. 
  
  A coach for product market fit? 
  
  Yep. 
  
  See, I know the principles of product market fit inside and out. I know we need to understand a problem, talk to users, and build simple solutions to their problems that they and only they need.  
  
  And at the same time, as we build product and experiment over the last 1.5 years, I've found our team changing direction and unsure of the  right  thing to build at times. 
  
  It's so much more difficult in practice than in theory. So even though I know the principles and I advise other start-ups on PMF, I hired a coach.  
  
  My coach wrote a book on behavior science. He's built his own businesses. He advises dozens of other businesses. He has an approach that enables you to test without building too much. I meet with him weekly to make sure we stay on course, and it's worth every single penny I pay him to increase the odds that we spend our time building the RIGHT thing. 
  
  Every top professional in the world has a coach. Why would I think I'm any different?

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story.
