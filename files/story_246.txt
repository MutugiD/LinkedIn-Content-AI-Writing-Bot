Every month, I sit down and write an Investor Update for Mylance. I can't recommend this practice more highly for founders, creators, or consultants. Here's why: 
  
  It forces a practice of sitting down and retrospectively looking at what we accomplished in the month.  
  
  It can be so easy to go from month to month, keeping my head down and just executing. 
  
  This forces a reflection that I wouldn't get otherwise. 
  
  Further, it gives me perspective of what we've done and how far we've come when I review the goals I set for each month. 
  
  How can this apply to your life? 
  
  We all have things we're trying to  achieve,  even if that is more free time or flexibility in our lives. This practice encourages a  step back  to look at how you're doing at the cloud level, giving you perspective and appreciation. 
  
  I'll be sharing our May Investor Update on LinkedIn in about a week! See you there :)
