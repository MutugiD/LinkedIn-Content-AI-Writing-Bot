got request pitch project. looked perfect - right alley. looked budget: $5,000 4 weeks. worth it. told so. ended $21.3k project (always specific!), $5k / month retainer afterwards. here's happened. told part-time job platform called catalant, figured i’d check out. made profile, weeks later, got invited pitch project. inherently skeptical figured invited hundreds pitch it, taking look, realized uber freight experience would extremely helpful company. saw budget. $5,000 four weeks. worth it. emailed back saying appreciated interest, me, going way deliver project scope, thus would need much higher rate. response: “try me, we’re rigid budget.” figured not. wrote proposal, stating clearly would met project requirements, would went far beyond project requirements (this needed pay way $5k). also noted best person job given i’d done almost identical work uber freight successfully. calculated hourly rate long thought project would take, needed $21,300 complete project (giving 15% discount $250 / hr rate). interview back forth, agreed project. what’s even better, project, got hands bit involved work, agreed 3 month retainer afterwards $5k / month, never asked single thing despite repeatedly letting know available. learned → there’s stated budget something doesn’t mean can’t try negotiate. important ask client budget flexibility, doesn’t, don’t want waste time. companies i’ve negotiated understand need value time appropriately, nobody ever offended i’ve asked for, politely decline project doesn’t work me. don’t forget you’re driver seat - clients often need need them, sometimes you’ll turn projects that’s ok! think side - would want hire someone who’s constantly thinking they’ve ripped under-valued? wouldn’t substantial distraction work need completed? want copy proposal sent them, comment shoot dm i'll send over! p.s. recommend catalant. every story like this, 50 people pitch projects never win them. got lucky. story asking value setting boundaries, immediately go sign catalant.
