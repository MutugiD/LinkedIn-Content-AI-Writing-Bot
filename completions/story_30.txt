Uber Freight started from humble beginnings in 2017 with a small team of employees manually moving 5-10 loads a day. Through dedicated user research, shipper sales, and a driver-facing app, the team was able to grow the company from scratch to a $4B valuation in just 5 years. During this time, they focused on a constant balance between growth, automation, and margin, and hustled incredibly hard to become a relevant line item before the Uber IPO.
