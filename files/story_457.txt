I'm hearing many MBA students are out of internships or jobs due to COVID-19. 
  
  I've recently launched Mylance, enabling the freelance life for millions, and would love your help. If you're in an MBA program or recently graduated, have a focus on marketing and go to market (previous start-up experience a plus), I'm offering an opportunity to get in at the ground floor.  
  
  I'm looking for someone to take ownership for growth over part of the business, treat it like their own, and grow it responsibly. This opportunity will give you first hand experience being an entrepreneur, and growing the business from scratch. 
  
  I could use help part-time or full-time, and can be flexible depending on your situation. If you or anyone you know might be a good fit for this, please send them my way!
