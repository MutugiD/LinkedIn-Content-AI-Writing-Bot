Calling all hiring managers!  
  
  As part of our work at Mylance, we've compiled a database of some of the best talent across Marketing, Operations, and Product mostly with expertise in Ridesharing, Food Delivery, and Logistics who used to work at top start-ups like Uber, Uber Freight, Cloudkitchens, Doordash, and Lyft. 
  
  I now send out a weekly newsletter (for free) that showcases 2-3 talented individuals that are readily available and open to part-time work.
