I love working with Mylance customers.  
  
  Helping them hone their personal brand, negotiate high rates, save money on taxes, or scope out projects so they can live a work-life of fulfillment and flexibility is incredibly rewarding and makes all the hard work worth it. 
  
  Congrats to Steven Zhou who shared this awesome news with us!
