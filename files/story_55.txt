Founding a company is incredibly difficult.  
  
  While your top goal is to create a product that not only your customers absolutely love but also scales to thousands or millions of people, but you also have to get SO much right along the way: 
  
  -Happy, empowered employees to build and service those customers 
  -Sound, compelling, and honest marketing materials to bring in new customers 
  -Email campaigns that help educate and inspire your customers 
  -Sound bookkeeping and accounting practices 
  -Legal agreements that keep everything with your customers, partners, and employees in line 
  -Cash in the bank to fund your operation 
  -Compelling branding that gives off the desired feeling to your customers 
  
  and SO much more. 
  
  To all the founders out there: what you're doing is incredibly impressive. Keep up the good work, keep perspective during the tough times, and be proud as hell knowing that you're doing your absolute best.
