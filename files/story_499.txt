In the early days (2014) at Uber, I managed the Raleigh market. Every day, we'd encounter difficult decisions, with riders claiming a driver did something against our terms, or vice versa. Back then, we didn't have a detailed set of rules of how to handle these tough situations. 
  
  Unless there was a police report or some other clear evidence, we had to listen to both sides of the story (there are ALWAYS two sides) and make a decision whether we'd give a warning, deactivate the rider / driver, or do nothing. I learned most often the true story of what happened was in the middle of the two stories. 
  
  This was a tough position to be in: the judge, jury, and executioner of the situation. It was a responsibility myself and the other city managers took seriously, especially given for many drivers, this was their livelihood and how they put food on the table. 
  
  Fast forward to now, I've founded a company and use Upwork all the time, for the past few years, to find quick access to talent for things like design, quick web development, email marketing, etc. The talent is hit or miss, but I have found some great people I continue to work with.  
  
  As of yesterday, I was currently in the middle of 3 different projects with them, ranging from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars (yes all my payments go through the platform).  
  
  And I got a notice that my account has been suspended, I cannot appeal the suspension, and it's permanent. I tried to login to see what happened, and I can't login. I contact support, and I'm met with the same message. I tweet at them and get the same response after they  look into it. 
  
  Maybe I unknowingly did violate a term of their service agreement. It happens. But to not let me know, not hear my side (of whatever I did wrong), or let me close out my projects / get in touch with my freelancers? 
  
  That's no way to treat your customers, no matter what happened. Fiverr I hope I have a better experience with you!
