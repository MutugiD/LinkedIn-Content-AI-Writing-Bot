Today I connected with a On Deck fellow who wants to consult while he starts a new company. He introduced himself as someone who specializes in data science, product, design, and strategy.  
  
  He told me he loves building things, being a leader, and creating a great work culture. While this is all great and no doubt he can add value to start-ups, I told him to get consulting gigs, he'd have to work to refine and narrow this niche, and find a way to make his impact on a company tangible to another founder. I asked him: 
  
  Where are you the top 1%?   
  What kind of work do you enjoy doing the most? 
  What kind of company do you want to work with? 
  
  We discussed these and after some back and forth we got to the sentence: 
  
  I combine product, design, and dev experience to get sustainability start-ups to MVP validation as quickly as possible to help find product market fit. 
  
  He now has his niche that he can pitch to founders that differentiates him, and tangibly communicates his value. 
  
  How do you narrow in on your niche and communicate your value?
