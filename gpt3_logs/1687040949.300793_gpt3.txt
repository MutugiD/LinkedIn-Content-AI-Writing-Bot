STORY:
================================

To launch Uber Eats in Miami, we needed to partner with 100 restaurants to go live. 
  
  Getting restaurants to give 30% of their revenue is NOT easy. Here's how we did it in 6 weeks: 
  
  1. We hired sales reps. To close a tough sale, you need to pound the pavement. So we hired 5 reps within 1 week by inviting candidates to a  happy hour,  narrowed it down to 10, interviewed them individually, and hired 5 hungry, personable sales folks. 
  
  2. Planning ahead of time. As the launcher on a very tight timeline, I had to know what  good  looked like. Meaning how many restaurants we needed to close every single day to be on target for the launch. So I modeled it, shared it with the team, and tracked against the projection daily.  
  
  3. Designing and refining the pitch. We needed a STRONG message to convince restaurants to partner with us and give us 30%. So we came up with a plan that would resonate and then iterated on it with every pitch. We'd circle up each day, share what worked and what didn't, and learn from each other.  
  
  4. We set quotas for how many restaurants the reps were supposed to close each day and each week, and we made it a friendly competition. We were on the same team, but also trying to  win.  Closing more restaurants resulted in performance bonuses and recognition. 
  
  5. We hustled but stayed patient. Getting the reps up to speed took some time, and sales started off slowly - we were well behind those targets I'd set. We needed to pick up momentum, so sharing best practices from the top-performing reps was KEY. One insight was the best time to catch a decision maker (10am - 11am before lunch and 4-5pm before the dinner rush were ideal times.) 
  
  6. With harder-to-close but important restaurants, we'd have a manager step in to close the deal. If a sales rep had the deal close but couldn't get it over the finish line, we'd bring a manager in to support and close. We were a team and we wanted our reps to know they had support. 
  
  7. We closed a number of restaurants by agreeing to a lower  starter  commission rate. It was a great way to get a restaurant signed up for 25% for 3 months, with the plan to increase after that first 90 days. 
  
  8. We hustled. We grinded it out. There was no silver bullet. It was a numbers game and a hustle game. We made it a friendly competition amongst the reps, we rallied together as a team, and we got the job done. 
  
  And all in all, we did get 100+ restaurants by the launch day, and launched on time.  
  
  It took an incredible amount of grit and hustle, but also smart planning, patience, and iteration. 
  
  I remind myself of those days as I build my company now. Even with the resources Uber had, it still took a ton of persistence and iteration to be successful. There are no shortcuts in business. You have to put in the hard and smart work to win.

RESPONSE:

When tasked with launching Uber Eats in Miami, I was up against an ambitious timeline. After hiring five dedicated sales reps, we set clear targets and created a pitch that resonated. We placed friendly competition amongst the reps to close the deals, and managers stepped in to support when needed. We hustled daily, shared best practices, and eventually closed over 100 deals by launch day!  It was an impressive display of grit and hustle, but also of smart planning, patience, and iteration. This experience reminds me that there are no shortcuts in business - hard and smart work are key to success!
