I have an exciting new opportunity for 10 participants to land their next $10k / month consulting client! 
  
  At Mylance, we're in the process of compiling a list of VC backed start-up companies in the ride-sharing, food delivery, and logistics spaces that have recently raised funding, and are hiring. These are great targets for consulting gigs.  
  
  We’re looking to support 10 consultants in finding their next gigs, focusing on Product, Marketing, and Operations.  
  
  First we'll work on refining your niche and your offer. We'll help you nail down your ideal client, and then teach you how to scope out a consulting project. 
  
  We'll then work directly with you to find leads, get you in front of these companies, and close the deals.  
  
  If you’d like to be included, please add a comment on this post and I'll shoot you a note!
