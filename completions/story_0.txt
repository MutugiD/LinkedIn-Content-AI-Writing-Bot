Are you leaving money on the table? You've worked hard for it, so it's time to capitalize on that knowledge and experience. That's what I did when I was part of the early team at Uber Freight. We created a revolutionary pricing system that was completely transparent and automated - no human touch or negotiation required. 

After leaving Uber Freight, I got a consulting gig with a smaller Freight brokerage that was struggling in the heavy haul space. After discussing their business, I realized they were losing money due to an inefficient booking process. So I used my knowledge from Uber to help them streamline the process and make it more transparent and automated. 

You have valuable knowledge from your experiences that may seem like common sense to you. But that common sense is worth its weight in gold to the right person in the right situation. Don't leave money on the table or work for free - monetize that knowledge and get the rewards you deserve. #consulting #sideincome #monetizeyourknowledge
