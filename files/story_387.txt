Thanks to those who attended the Mylance Webinar yesterday on launching your Freelance Consulting Business! 
  
  If you missed it and want to take a look, I recorded it and uploaded it here: https://lnkd.in/dSDG5HF 
  
  I gave an overview of:  
  
  1. How I found my first client, and how you can too 
  
  2. How important it is to curate your niche  
  
  3. Set your rate and use it for monthly retainers 
  
  4. How to think about equity vs cash 
  
  5. How to draw the line between  helping for free  and setting up a formal arrangement 
  
  6. Why we sign a contract 
  
  7. How Mylance can help! 
  
  Enjoy!
