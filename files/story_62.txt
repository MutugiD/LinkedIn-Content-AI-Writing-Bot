So much of my consulting success was how I positioned myself. 
  
  It's the difference between a $20k / month project, and a rejection. 
  
  Sounds dramatic, but it's true. 
  
  I work in Operations for start-ups  vs  I launch 3-sided food delivery marketplaces for early-stage start-ups. 
  
  It's a big difference, and it's extremely difficult to come up with yourself. 
  
  Your positioning impacts: 
  
  1. How you verbally talk about your value-add 
  
  2. The language you use on your LinkedIn 
  
  3. The language on your personal website (if you have one) 
  
  4. Your ideal client targeting 
  
  5. Details on your project proposals  
  
  If you're reading this thinking  damn, I need some help with this  then you're in luck. 
  
  I'm working with 5 individuals to help with your consulting positioning so you can be confident and clear in how you present yourself.  
  
  I'll also include a full audit of your personal website and/or LinkedIn profile, and the full Consulting Playbook we've built at Mylance that we've used in our high-end Accelerator. 
  
  Just comment  me!  if you're interested, and I'll send over more information.
