Every time I've gotten comfortable in my career, I made a change.  
  
  I had a great management consulting job out of college. But after two years, I wasn't challenged anymore. I was doing my client's job for them without getting the full pay. So I quit. 
  
  And joined Uber. Which was all new. Operations. Marketplace dynamics. SQL. Pricing. Customer support.  
  
  But after two years in the Rides business, I again wasn't feeling challenged. So I moved over to Uber Eats and launched Miami and Milan.  
  
  Again, all new. Launching. Restaurant sales. A 3-sided marketplace. Grassroots marketing. Managing a team in a foreign country. Incredibly tight deadlines. 
  
  But after two successful launches, I again was ready for a new challenge. So I joined the Uber Freight team pre-product. Now a B2B challenge. A whole new industry (Freight). Enterprise sales cycles. Digital automation.  
  
  And after two years there, I'd hit my ceiling. And more importantly, was ready to finally go out on my own. So I did the scariest thing I could do. I quit. With nothing lined up. 
  
  And bet on myself. I found my first client and started my consulting business, making $25k / month with my first client. But after two years of consulting for start-ups, I was ready to move on.  
  
  I was ready to build a company that helped others. So I founded Mylance. And this is my current challenge: to build a business that helps millions of others and to build a team that's empowered and valued. 
  
  I'm far from done. In fact, Mylance is just beginning.  
  
  For me to be fulfilled in my work, I need to be on my most difficult path. This is my programming. It's what drives me. It's what fills me up.  
  
  It's certainly not easy. But it's definitely the most rewarding.
