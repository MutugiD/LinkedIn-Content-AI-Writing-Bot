Get a lot of people asking for advice from you?  
  
  Here are 3 tips to help you monetize your experience and get paid for your expertise: 
  
  1. Have a paid Calendly for your time. You can't help everyone for free. At some point, your expertise is worth money. I think you can send a really nice note like: 
  
  As you can guess, I get a lot of requests to help {customer type} with [value they want] and I'd LOVE to help everyone for free. 
  
  If I did, I'd be on the phone most of my day and wouldn't have any time to prioritize and grow [your business]! 
  
  But I do leave a few slots per week open to folks who value my expertise and are able to invest in the advice which you can book here [link to paid Calendly]. 
  
  2. You can sign up for the expert network calls through Guidepoint, Thirdbridge, Ridgetop Research, GLG, Coleman, etc. and charge upwards of $1,000 / hr for your expertise. My tips to those calls are linked here: https://lnkd.in/e2viZPq4 
  
  3. You can offer a free 15 min free session (where frankly you ask more questions than answer them) to showcase your expertise to set-up a paid call. Just want to be careful of your time and not give away too much.
