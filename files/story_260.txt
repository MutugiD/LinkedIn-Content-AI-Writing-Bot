The latest data shows that 45% of working Americans report having a side hustle. 
  
  Some of the top options for a side hustle: 
  
  -Sell a physical product (online or not) 
  -Sell your expertise 
  -Build software and get paying users (e.g., SaaS) 
  -Trade stocks or crypto 
  -Write content (blog, medium, etc.) 
  -Create video content (e.g., YouTube, TikTok, Instagram) 
  
  
  None of these are easy. Why? Because it requires you to be your own boss and put yourself out there.  
  
  But you want that extra income. And you want the flexibility of being your own boss.  
  
  Most of the above require a product. Something that you can sell in exchange for money. Making a great, sellable product takes a ton of time, effort, feedback, and often money. 
  
  What if there's an item on that list that you've already been working on for years?  
  
  You've worked hard, you've gotten and incorporated feedback, you've put time and money into education and follow-on courses, you've invested in coaching. 
  
  That product that you've worked so hard on is already very developed. And that product is you.  
  
  You've spent years refining it, taking feedback, learning, and growing. 
  
  And because of that you can be earning $10k or $20k or more per month monetizing your experience by consulting directly for companies.  
  
  You've put in the work, and now it's your turn to monetize it and reap all the benefits.
