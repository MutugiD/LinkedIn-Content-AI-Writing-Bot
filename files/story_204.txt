I wanted my first consulting client immediately. Who wouldn't? But that's not how it worked.  
  
  Nothing in business works that way. Everything is a game of numbers. A funnel. A conversion rate. 
  
  Finding my first consulting client was the same thing.  
  
  I didn't know how to approach this. It felt like a black box. But I wanted to give myself a chance. And to do that, I had to put at least a number of feelers out there.  
  
  So I did it in the most lightweight possible. I didn't make a website, come up with a company name, or design a logo. 
  
  The only thing I did was work on my offer. What could I offer a company and who would be the ideal company for that offer? 
  
  Once I felt good about that, I reached out to 12 contacts on LinkedIn. 
  
  11 people either ignored me or said  no. 
  
  1 person was interested. And that led me to my first consulting deal: which was $250 / hr at 25 hours per week: $25,000 per month.  
  
  If you reach out to 12 people and 11 say no, you might feel rejected. But the reality is, it's just a game of numbers to get in front of the right person.  
  
  You could look at it that 11 people got me $0 in revenue, or that 12 people got me $25,000 in revenue. That's $2,000 per outreach per month.  
  
  If every outreach you do is worth $2k per month, you can simply increase your monthly revenue with more outreaches. 
  
  Play the game of numbers to win. It's that simple.
