We got one of our Fractional COO customers 4 calls booked in 2 weeks. 
  
  I expect he will convert at least 2 of those calls to paid clients, with an average contract value of $7.5k - $10k / month each. 
  
  Here's how we did it: 
  
  1. We used our Lead Gen engine to identify leads in his niche, where he has direct, unique experience. We got very very narrow with this 
  
  2. With the contact information for those founders, we uploaded a CSV into an email drip campaign software 
  
  3. We wrote two versions of outreach copy that focused on the pain his target customer has, and how he adds value. We made sure to legitimize his experience in the note 
  
  4. We kicked off the campaign A/B testing the outreach note to 27 contacts, with two follow-up emails, one 3 and the other 4 days after 
  
  Here are the results from the campaign: 
  
  -79.2% open rate 
  -37.5% response rate 
  -5 positive responses 
  -4 booked calls 
  
  Curated outreach DOES work. It just needs to be done right: to a curated list, with a compelling note, and with follow-ups. 
  
  Note: I was blown away by the open rate. Shoot me a DM if you'd like to know what copy we used!
