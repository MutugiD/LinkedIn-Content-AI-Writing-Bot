many know this, founded mylance, co-founded another start-up 2 friends went nowhere. here's happened: idea travel space building curated yelp recommendations network. biggest problem: test mvp built it. designed built thought product people wanted. spent 9 months working it. held meetings 5am co-founders go day jobs. got 90% way mvp realized fully validated building product people wanted. developer got bigger role company, quickly started. taking learning mylance, first products completely manual. wanted test demand (actually collect customer money) built software. this? 1. first tax product zero software - cpa managing customers' quickbooks. $120/month, nobody churned. 2. first bootcamp run completely via google sheets, zoom, slack. $1249 value prop there, customers paid it. loved it. nobody cared fancy software. lesson: validate idea finding way get paying customers without fancy software. can't get someone pay, probably business. #lessonlearned #startups #entrepreneurialjourney
