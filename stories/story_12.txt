When I first started consulting, I would tell clients  I worked in Operations at Uber for 4.5 years. 
  
  They had zero idea what that meant.  
  
  Over time, I learned, tested, and honed my niche.  
  
  I learned to say  I launch and scale 2 and 3-sided food delivery and logistics marketplaces for tech start-ups. 
  
  I get asked all the time: what makes a great Freelance Consultant? 
  
  How you package your experience and skillset to a potential client is everything.  
  
  With my first pitch, nobody knew what I did. With the latter, a client knew exactly what I could do for their company, and if their challenges were related to my expertise, they would inquire to hear more and it set me up to find a project with them.  
  
  The first exercise we go through in the Mylance Bootcamp helps our customers hone their niche and frame their experience in a way that easily and tangibly communicates what they do. It can make all the difference in closing a 5-figure per month consulting deal!
