I knew I had good experience. But when I pitched my first consulting client, I had no idea how much to charge. 
  
  Here's how I thought about it (and came up with $284/hr): 
  
  1. First, what were my financial goals? What would  good  look like for me? This I found out was key: we always want  more  and if we don't call out what success is for us, we'll never be happy. 
  
  2. What value was I creating my client? What impact would my work have on the business? This can be hard to exactly quantify, but it put me in the right frame of mind of value-based pricing, not charging for my time. 
  
  3. Ok that's great and all, but how did I come up with a number. Let's keep it simple: 
  
  1. I took my  ideal salary  if I were to get hired to an awesome role tomorrow (I shot high but was honest here) 
  2. Add in what an annual cash bonus might be 
  3. Add in what an annual equity value might be 
  4. Multiply by 140% (taking into account no PTO, and additional costs like health insurance, additional taxes, and business costs like a bookkeeper and software) 
  5. Divide by 48 weeks per year (4 weeks of vacation) and by 40 hours per week  
  
  Taking the above, we calculate: 
  
  1. $270,000 
  2. + $40,000 = $310,000 
  3. + $80,000 = $390,000 
  4. *1.4 = $546,000 
  5. /(48*40) = $284 
  
  This seemed a bit high to me, but what did I have to lose? I went with it. If I could consult 25 hours per week, this would get me $28k per month. Worked for me! 
  
  I went to the client with this and was incredibly nervous. Would they tell me I was crazy? Laugh me out of the room? 
  
  They told me it was  a little high  and that $250 / hr would be workable.  
  
  I was overjoyed. 
  
  A learning from my first project: you never want to charge hourly. You want to use this number to figure out how much time a project will take, and charge a monthly retainer or project fee. 
  
  Is this method perfect? No. But it gives you a framework to come up with monthly retainers that work for your goals. If you can use this framework along with value-based pricing, you're in great shape. 
  
  How do you figure out how much to charge for your consulting business?
