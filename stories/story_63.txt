If you do nothing else, two things need to happen to get your next consulting client: 
  
  1. Get on the phone: every single consulting project started with a phone call 
  
  2. Convert calls where there's an opportunity to work together to a proposal 
  
  If you aren't doing, #1, then you don't have an opportunity to do #2. 
  
  Put yourself out there. Network. Do outreach. Be a thought leader. Publish content. On the calls see if there's an opportunity to work together.  
  
  Get on 100 calls in the next month. Good things will happen.
