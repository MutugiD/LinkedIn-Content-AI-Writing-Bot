Let's be honest: nobody outside of Uber knows what  Operations at Uber  means. 
  
  It sounds fine, but nobody had any idea what I was capable of. 
  
  When talking to potential consulting clients, I learned to pitch myself as an early-stage marketplace launch expert, and I'd back it up by sharing that I launched Uber Eats in Miami and Milan, and I'd launched the Uber Freight business as well. 
  
  So my niche became,  I specialize in launching and scaling 2 and 3-sided marketplaces for early-stage start-ups. 
  
  This not only sounds a hell of a lot better than  I worked in Operations at Uber,  but it also makes sense to a potential client. 
  
  They get what value I'm capable of providing to their business. 
  
  As a consultant, your goal to narrow it down as much as possible. 
  
  You might think of yourself as a  jack of all trades,  and maybe you are! But that's not going to help you find a client. 
  
  There are likely thousands of people that have a similar set of experiences as you. 
  
  How are you going to set yourself apart? The way to do this is to get incredibly specific about what you do. 
  
  For me, I leaned hard into my food delivery and freight experience. 
  
  How many people had owned the full launch of a food delivery marketplace? A few, but not a ton. 
  
  What is that thing for you? For me, this is how I got my first client.
