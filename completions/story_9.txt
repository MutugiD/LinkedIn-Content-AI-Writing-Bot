When I left Uber, I decided to try my hand at something different and started looking for part-time, contract roles while I experimented. Out of the 12 companies I contacted, 11 said no, but the 12th said yes. Therefore, that became my first client, and the start of my freelance consulting career. This story shows that when pursuing something new, failure is inevitable. We must accept no as part of the process and use it as an opprotunity to reach a new level of success.
