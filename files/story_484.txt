Most don't know this but Uber Eats didn't start out as a traditional food delivery marketplace.  
  
  Uber originally thought it had a better idea instead: 
  
  Uber wanted to deliver food as quickly as a rider could get a vehicle.  
  
  This meant under 5 minutes. 
  
  How? 
  
  Uber partnered with a few restaurants in each city, and ahead of the lunchtime rush, Uber would pack driver's cars with hot meals.  
  
  Those drivers would then drive around the central business district of a few cities (we piloted this in DC, LA, Atlanta, and Barcelona) and deliver hot meals to mostly business professionals at lunchtime. 
  
  Customers were happy. But the business model didn't work. 
  
  There were tons of food waste, the customer wasn't willing to pay a premium for food in <5 min, and the economics simply didn't work. 
  
  Uber tried to figure out this business line for a full year and invested heavily. 
  
  But it wasn't meant to be. 
  
  So did Uber give up?  
  
  Of course not. It took an existing business model of a traditional food delivery marketplace and used its tech and driver network to improve upon it.  
  
  And within 7 years, Uber Eats grew to hit $14B in Gross Bookings in Q4 2022. 
  
  Even the largest companies pivot. The key is to never give up.
