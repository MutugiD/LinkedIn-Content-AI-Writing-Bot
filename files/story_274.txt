Birthdays are always a weird day to me. In the past, I've thought about it as a day to  do whatever I want.   
  
  But as I've gotten older, I've embraced more of this mindset in my normal day to day. I'm designing a life I love, where every day I'm working on projects that fulfill me, working alongside great people, and taking the time for things I enjoy outside of work like play, family, friends, and time off.  
  
  Today I can design the exact day I want. For me, that's taking care of myself at the gym, doing work to move my business forward, taking some time off this afternoon to reflect, and then spending time later with family and friends. 
  
  But nothing needs to be special about a day to do that. I want my every day to include most of those components, and while I'm not there yet, that's what I'm working towards.  
  
  Part of that work fulfillment for me is helping others work through barriers to achieve what they want in life: more time with their kids, free time to explore a passion, or a bit of side income to launch that business they've always wanted to. 
  
  And I feel incredibly lucky that I get to design a life I love. And if our work at Mylance inspires one more person each day to start designing their life, the work is all worth it.
