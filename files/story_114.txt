You're probably selling your experience short. 
  
  You have years of professional experience, education, coaching, feedback, learnings, mistakes, late nights at the office, work trips, and more.  
  
  Youâ€™ve changed companies. Helped them achieve incredible outcomes.  
  
  With those experiences come learnings.  
  
  And you can add tremendous value to other companies with those learnings to help them avoid mistakes, skip trial and error, and achieve their goals. 
  
  What it takes is:  
  
  1. Positioning yourself 
  2. Clearly communicating your value-add 
  3. Putting yourself out there 
  4. Not stopping at the first few  nos 
  
  Stop selling yourself short. Go get what you've earned.
