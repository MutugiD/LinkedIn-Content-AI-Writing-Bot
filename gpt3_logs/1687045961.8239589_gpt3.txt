PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

When I first left Uber, I faced a lot of rejection. I decided to see if I could work for myself as a consultant. It was a bit of a random, fleeting thought.  
  
  I put myself out there to 12 companies. Here's what happened: 
  
  -I told them I wasn't open to full-time, but could use my experience to help them out part-time 
  -11 companies ignored me or said  no 
  -1 company was interested, and asked for a pitch 
  -I had no idea what a good pitch looked like, so I completely made one up, including a rate that felt absurdly high ($287 / hr) 
  -They liked my pitch, interviewed me, and after seeing I was a good fit to help them, told me they couldn't quite meet $287/hr, but that $250/hr with 10% of that in equity was OK 
  
  I was blown away. Putting out $287 / hr felt terrifying. I was worried they'd laugh me out of the room and I'd lose them. But they didn't. They countered with an offer that was incredible for me. $250/hr for 25 hours per week was $25k / month for part-time work. 
  
  Many told me I couldn't work part-time in Operations. Others told me that kind of money is impossible for part-time work. 
  
  Neither turned out to be true, and I found out by putting myself out there, getting rejected, and taking a chance.  
  
  There's no silver bullet to getting the life you want. But if you're willing to put yourself out there, overcome your fears, and do it anyway, you just might surprise yourself.

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story. 

SUMMARY: 




==========

RESPONSE:

This is a story about taking risks and never giving up. I faced a lot of rejection when I left Uber, but I didnâ€™t let that stop me. I put myself out there to 12 companies as a consultant, and while 11 of them rejected me, one was interested. I didn't know what I was doing, so I made up a pitch, which included an absurdly high rate of $287 / hr. Miraculously, they countered with an incredible offer of $250/hr for 25 hours per week. This story shows that even if people tell you something is impossible, it might just be possible when you put yourself out there and take a chance.
