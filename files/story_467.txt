Do you get that feeling you could work for your company in 20 hours per week and still add a ton of value? Interested in choosing who you work with, working with multiple companies at one time, and managing your time? 
  
  I've been a contract freelancer for 18 months now working across a dozen clients adding value and working part-time.  
  
  You can do this. Message me to learn how I did it, and how I can help you do it too
