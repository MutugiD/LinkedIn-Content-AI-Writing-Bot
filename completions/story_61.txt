As a fractional executive, standing out from the competition by emphasizing industry and company-building experience, unique skills, and tenure is essential. Showcasing these unique talents in combination can help solidify a customer's decision in choosing you over another candidate. Examples include being a data-driven Fractional COO with a decade of experience in the cannabis industry and additional expertise in SQL, R, and Python or a Fractional COO with additional experience in marketing funnels and email copywriting.
