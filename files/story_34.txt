Successful independent consultants: what's one thing that's helped you the most in being successful on your journey? 
  
  For me, it was honing my niche and finding a way to present that in a way that made tangible sense to clients, legitimized my experience, and clearly communicated the value I could bring. 
  
  Instead of telling clients I  worked in Operations for Uber for 4.5 years. 
  
  I would say  I specialize in launching and scaling two and three sided B2B and B2C marketplaces given my experience launching UberEATS in Miami and Milan and Uber Freight in the US.
