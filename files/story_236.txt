I often get asked why I left a lucrative life of consulting to build my own company. 
  
  It's true, it doesn't really make a lot of rational sense: I went from making $25k / month part-time to making nearly nothing while I build my own company working my butt off. 
  
  It turns out, money isn't the main driver in my fulfillment. In fact, it's barely a factor.  
  
  I get fulfilled out of helping change people's lives. When I help someone launch their own consulting business and it replaces their W2 income (and then some!) it's the most incredible feeling in the world. 
  
  I've helped single moms work when their child is taking naps, women close the gender pay gap, and entrepreneurs fund their software company through consulting gigs to name a few. 
  
  I wasn't getting that feeling as a consultant. I love consulting because of the lifestyle it provides.  
  
  I am passionate about flexible, fulfilling work.  
  
  So I'm trying to live it myself, marrying flexible work (working for Mylance) with fulfilling work (helping others). 
  
  I'm not perfect at it, but I truly believe there's a world where I work in a flexible way with Mylance, build this company with incredible colleagues, and be fulfilled in our mission for what we're doing. 
  
  And whatever your fulfilling work life looks like, I want to help you get there too.
