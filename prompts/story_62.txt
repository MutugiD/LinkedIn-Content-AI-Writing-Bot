I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

So much of my consulting success was how I positioned myself. 
  
  It's the difference between a $20k / month project, and a rejection. 
  
  Sounds dramatic, but it's true. 
  
  I work in Operations for start-ups  vs  I launch 3-sided food delivery marketplaces for early-stage start-ups. 
  
  It's a big difference, and it's extremely difficult to come up with yourself. 
  
  Your positioning impacts: 
  
  1. How you verbally talk about your value-add 
  
  2. The language you use on your LinkedIn 
  
  3. The language on your personal website (if you have one) 
  
  4. Your ideal client targeting 
  
  5. Details on your project proposals  
  
  If you're reading this thinking  damn, I need some help with this  then you're in luck. 
  
  I'm working with 5 individuals to help with your consulting positioning so you can be confident and clear in how you present yourself.  
  
  I'll also include a full audit of your personal website and/or LinkedIn profile, and the full Consulting Playbook we've built at Mylance that we've used in our high-end Accelerator. 
  
  Just comment  me!  if you're interested, and I'll send over more information.

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story.
