Three differences between a professional who is still wanting to consult, and one who's making $20k / month on the side: 
  
  
  
  1. A great offer. You know the exact person or company you add value, you know what unique value you add, and you how to pitch it. 
  
  2. You actually do pitch it. You're not afraid to put yourself out there (or you are afraid and you do it anyways) and ask what you want. 
  
  3. You invest in yourself. You might have imposter syndrome, but you manage it. You hire a coach, join a community, and or find a buddy to hold you accountable.  
  
  If you've been wanting to work for yourself  for a while now  and haven't taken the leap, DM me - I'd love to chat with you.
