This case study demonstrates the power of curating and personalizing outreach to a smaller, targeted group. Our Fractional COO customer received four calls from a Lead Gen engine, an automated email drip campaign, and two versions of a message crafted to address the specific pain points of their target customers. This campaign achieved a 79.2% open rate, 37.5% response rate, 5 positive responses, and ultimately 4 booked calls. The success of this campaign underscores the importance of conducting outreach the right way: calculated, curated, and followed up.
