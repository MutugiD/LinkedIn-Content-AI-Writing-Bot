Figuring out how much to charge my clients was intimidating as hell. I had no idea where to start.  
  
  4 years of building up my own 6-figure business and helping thousands of others, here are my top 3 tips: 
  
  First, let's set the stage. There's no RIGHT way to do this. And as you acquire more experience, skills, and the ability to impact a company, you can charge as much as a client is willing to pay you.  
  
  If you can offer 40% more, you can charge 40% more. No more waiting for someone to promote you or some arbitrary bonus. You charge what value you bring, period. 
  
  With that, let's get to the tips. 
  
  1. Set your goal. What would  good  look like to you? If you want to earn $25k / month, then you know you need to price 2 clients around $12.5k / month or 3 clients around $8.3k / month. Know your floor and do not agree to anything below it. 
  
  2. Price according to the value you bring, not the time you spend. If you spend 5 hours per week but drive $100k / month worth of value, charge them for that value created (at least a portion of it). Not your time. 
  
  3. Constantly test the waters. Raise your rates with each new client. Test the boundaries. You have nothing to lose. If they say  no,  then you know you hit a ceiling and then let THEM counter (do not negotiate against yourself).
