You're an amazing marketer. You nail branding, positioning, ideal customer personas, and acquisition strategies. 
  
  But when it comes to marketing yourself, you fall short. 
  
  Why? I have no idea. But it's the reality for most. 
  
  Don't let your ego get in the way. Ask for help. Get support from a coach or a friend. 
  
  We always struggle to see ourselves objectively. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Just don't let it hold you back.
