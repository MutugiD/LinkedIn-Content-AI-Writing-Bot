Cash in your savings account is an asset.  
  
  As it sits in cash, it devalues (inflation). 
  
  If you put it in the market, you’re hoping for 8-10% (on average) annual return over time after taxes. 
  
  But if you invest it in yourself, the ROI is infinite. 
  
  Your ability to make a return on that investment is immediate, ongoing, and constantly compounds. 
  
  In my consulting business I constantly “gave myself a raise” as I got better and better at my offer, my pitch, negotiation techniques, and more.  
  
  And we just had a customer go from $5k to $15k / month in the first week of our Accelerator program! He's certainly happy he invested in himself, because he has that business forever. 
  
  You'll never regret an investment in yourself, and it will constantly pay itself back over and over.
