Making money on the expert networks has been great. I’ve made up to $1,000 / hr. But it’s not sustainable. I turned those experiences into multi-month long consulting engagements.  
  
  Here’s how I did it: 
  
  
  Working with companies like Third Bridge, Guidepoint, and GLG showed me how valuable my expertise was. Those “Expert Network” companies match you with an investor or researcher who wants to learn more about the space. And they wanted to learn it from me! (And probably thousands of others).  
  
  But I had a ton of learnings from my experience that they wanted to know. So they pay good money for it. 
  
  The problem was they were short and unreliable. $1,000 an hour is great, but not if it’s only for 5 hours per month. I wanted something more reliable and sustainable. 
  
  So I got to thinking: what do companies need that’s similar in nature but would require them to bring me on for months? 
  
  Companies, specifically ventured backed companies, have aggressive goals they need to meet with milestones along the way to unlock additional rounds of funding. If I could help those companies meet those goals but avoiding mistakes, they’d value me a lot, pay me good money, and I’d stick around for at least a few months. 
  
  So I did just that. I found companies that would value my experience, and reached out to them in a curated way. 
  
  The biggest key for me to have success in this: I narrowed down my value-add. I spoke to only my most impressive career accomplishments, and told them based on that experience, how I could help them win, avoiding the mistakes I’d learned from at Uber. 
  
  And it worked. Over 2 years I averaged $25k / month in only 25 hours per week.  
  
  I’m not special. Anyone with good experience can do this. Including you.
