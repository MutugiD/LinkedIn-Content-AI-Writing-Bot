The key to finding your next consulting client is to get on the phone and start networking. Put yourself out there, be a thought leader, and publish content. Doing outreach and having 100 calls in the next month will open the doors to potential opportunities to convert those calls to a proposal. Make the call to start the journey and you'll start to see the results!
