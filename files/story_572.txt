**Webinar Alert!**  
  
  After 4.5 years at Uber, I started helping start-ups on a contract basis and part-time, making more than my Uber salary in half the number of hours. Since then, I've helped dozens of others launch their freelance businesses, set their rates, scope out projects, and close clients. 
  
  Most tech professionals have their first freelance gig fall in their lap. It's awesome! You found that  side hustle  that you've been hearing about and are excited. 
  
  But, you have questions. Your former manager, a friend, or a colleague is asking you to help with their start-up.  
  
  But, how do you get a great monthly rate? 
  Do you need an LLC?  
  Do you take equity or cash?  
  Where do you draw the line between  helping for free  and setting up a formal arrangement?  
  What about a contract? 
  
  We're going to go over all of this and more in our next Free Live Webinar! Join us Thursday Aug 20th at 5pm PT. RSVP at the link in the comments and comment  Excited!  if you're in.
