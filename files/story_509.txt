I'd always wanted to start and have my own business.  
  
  I started and failed, so many times. 
  
  In college, I worked with a few friends to start a stock trading game. We never even launched. 
  
  After college, I built a website to maximize credit card points. We never got off the ground. 
  
  I then worked with two friends for 9 months to build a travel recommendations engine within your network. We never launched. 
  
  I also had countless other energizing chats with friends where we agreed to pursue a project only for it to lose steam in 2-3 weeks.  
  
  When I quit Uber, I decided these  false starts  were over. I was going to follow through on ONE project, and not stop or give up no matter what. 
  
  It took me nearly two years to decide what to move forward with because I knew I needed something I could work on every day for at least 7-10 years. 
  
  When I finally had a problem to solve I was genuinely excited about, I committed to it. I incorporated. I moved forward. And no matter how hard it got, I kept pushing. 
  
  If you have that entrepreneurial spirit, these  false starts  probably resonate with you.  
  
  The only way to see something through is to  
  
  1. Pick something you're genuinely passionate about 
  2. Commit to it with everything you got 
  
  It's going to get hard. You're going to get rejected. You're going to have  failures.  And it's how you decide to react to those that determines whether it's a  false start  or a business.
