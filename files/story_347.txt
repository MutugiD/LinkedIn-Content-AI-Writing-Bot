When I started consulting, I had constant worries. Worries that a client would fire me. Worries that I wouldn't find another client. Worries that a client would re-negotiate with me. The unknown of going out on my own was incredibly scary, especially in the first few months. 
  
  Added to this fear was I didn't know what I was doing. I hadn't done it before. There wasn't a playbook. I was making it up as I went. 
  
  Situation after situation that came up, and I figured each one out. I was let go by a client. I did re-negotiate a deal. I found a new client, and then another. 
  
  Anything that's rewarding professionally is scary at the beginning. It's an unknown, and there's a chance of failure. Overcoming that fear and just getting started is the only way to push the boundaries, and achieve what you really want in your career. 
  
  It hasn't been easy. But for me, it's crucial to keep pushing forward in a way that makes me happy, fulfilled, and proud regardless of the outcomes
