The ONE big difference between the people who want a consulting business who will make it happen and the ones who won't: 
  
  Commitment.  
  
  It's not easy to make this a reality. It's starting a business. To start a business you need: 
  
  1. An Offer 
  
  2. Customers 
  
  3. Pricing 
  
  4. Support 
  
  5. A legal entity 
  
  And many more, but most importantly not on that list: confidence. 
  
  You need to BELIEVE in yourself that you can add tremendous value to companies. That they'd be lucky to have you.  
  
  If you don't believe it, who will? 
  
  To overcome imposter thoughts, rejection, and all the steps required to be in business for yourself, you need to be fully committed. So before you embark on the journey, ask yourself if you're really all in. 
  
  And if you are, then go for it and don't stop until you've succeeded.
