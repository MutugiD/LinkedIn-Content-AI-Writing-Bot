 You canâ€™t build a reputation on what you are going to do.  -Henry Ford 
  
  Ford was one of the best entrepreneurs and investors in global history, completely revolutionizing how we move around the globe. 
  
  But his first company was a failure. Even though he spent over a decade researching and building, the product he built was of low quality and more expensive than he wanted. There was little demand, and he dissolved the company.  
  
  But he didn't quit. Far from it. He kept working, teaming up with other passionate entrepreneurs to build a better product.  
  
  Two years later in 1903 after his previous company closed, he re-incorporated the Ford Motor company. And the Model T eventually debuted in 1908, another 5 years later.  
  
  The quote above isn't about building a reputation.  
  
  It's about starting, working hard, persevering through setbacks, and building what you're passionate about.  
  
  You can spend all the time you want thinking, planning, researching, and strategizing. But nothing beats getting started and pushing through every single obstacle thrown your way.
