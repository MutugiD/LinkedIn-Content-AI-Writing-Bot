Thinking being a business owner is amazing? Well, part of it is! You call the shots and you're in complete control. 
  
  But it's also incredibly difficult. 
  
  As a business owner, here are some of the things you need to be prepared to deal with: 
  
  1. Unhappy customers. By definition you can't and won't make everyone happy. 
  
  2. Frustrated employees. At times, they won't be happy with you. You'll make mistakes. You're human. 
  
  3. Stress. The business won't always be performing well. When it's not, it's not easy to stay calm and handle. 
  
  4. Full liability. No matter what happens, the buck stops with you. Whether it's a threatening customer, legal issue, or accounting problem, you'll be the one dealing with it. 
  
  Anytime you see a business owner and you're frustrated, try to have some empathy for them. It's not easy, and they're likely trying their best. 
  
  If you're an owner, give yourself a massive pat on the back. You're growing. You're learning.  
  
  And no matter the outcome, you're in that arena. And that's one hell of an accomplishment in it of itself.
