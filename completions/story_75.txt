As an employee, it can be hard to predict how much you will earn. With freelance consulting, however, you can charge for the value you bring, as much as a client is willing to pay. As you acquire more experience, skills and become a better consultant, you can increase your rates â€“ no promotions or arbitrary bonuses needed.
