Everything I've accomplished in my career, I had to ask for.  
  
  I wanted to work in abroad so I applied for the Madrid UberEATS GM when I wasn't fluent in Spanish. I knew I could never get this job but it got me in touch with the right people where I offered to help with UberEATS in Europe. After just lending a helping hand for a few months, they asked me to launch UberEATS in Milan.  
  
  I wanted to work for myself as a freelancer so I asked if a full-time role could be made into a consulting gig. They let me and I ended up making $25k a month in 25 hours per week, kicking off a 6-figure consulting business, and the foundation for Mylance. 
  
  Nothing in life is handed to you on a silver platter. And yeah you might get turned down a bunch - I have. But if you keep asking and you keep pushing, you'll eventually get where you're trying to go.  
  
  After all, what do you have to lose by asking?
