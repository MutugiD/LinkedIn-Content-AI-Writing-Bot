I genuinely loved working for Uber: the people, the pace, the growth, the challenges. It was unlike anything I'd ever experienced. 
  
  But after 4.5 years and 3 business lines, I was ready to forge my own path, and in hindsight, it was a much easier transition than I expected: 
  
  1. First, I built up a back-up plan. I polished my resume and I interviewed at a few companies. If it didn't work out on my own, I wanted to know my worth in the market  
  
  2. I did a ton of 1-hour expert consulting calls through companies like Guidepoint, Third Bridge, Coleman, and Ridgetop Research. At $1,000 / hr, this was really nice supplemental income 
  
  3. I took nearly every networking call that came in. I used to turn down every call. Now, I took them. Some went nowhere. But some resulted in paid engagement whether it was consulting, recruiting placements, or a helpful intro 
  
  4. I threw A LOT at the wall. I started a blog. I bought and sold a tiny e-commerce company. I consulted. I started writing on LinkedIn. I started (and promptly shut down) a tech company. 
  
  5. Nearly two years later, I had a thriving consulting business, an idea for a software company, and most importantly, the belief in myself that I didn't need a massive tech company behind me or a  stable  job.  
  
  I learned I would be just fine working for myself. And could embrace the flexibility, ownership, and freedom that came along with it. And I'm never turning back.
