I want to get in the habit of highlighting some talented expert consultants from our Mylance community. So here it goes! 
  
  Earlier this year, Jordan Regenie went through the Mylance Accelerator to build his niche. But then he strayed away from it to reach a broader audience.  
  
  Recently he realigned on the importance of his original niche, and in this conversation, he discusses his journey of discovering and rediscovering his niche to help him land consulting clients. 
  
  Shout out to our community manager Nityesh Agarwal for facilitating a great conversation!
