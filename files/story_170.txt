One of the best way to get inbound from potential consulting clients: share thoughts on your area of expertise in a LinkedIn post.  
  
  This isn't a note on LinkedIn that says HEY I'M CONSULTING LOOK AT ME! This is a message sharing your learnings on a topic where you're an expert. 
  
  So many people do not want to do this. They don’t want to self-promote. But we don’t look at it as self-promotion.  
  
  You’re not saying how amazing you are. You’re sharing something you learned that might be able to help others.  
  
  Maybe you helped grow Dropbox’s legendary referral program and you want to share your top 5 learnings that other businesses could apply. 
  
  They would not only get value out of reading that, but they also might want to hire you to help grow their referral program. 
  
  You add value (win) and maybe get hired for a part-time engagement (win!). 
  
  Most don't want to do this. But most people also don't have their own consulting business. The choice is yours.
