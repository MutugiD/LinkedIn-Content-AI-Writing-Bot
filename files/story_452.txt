I spoke with a mutual connection yesterday that was trying to close a new consulting client. For his freelancing business, the average company pays him $2500 a month, and he has a number of clients in this range. 
  
  After diving into his offering, telling me how unique his skillset is, and what a differentiator it is for his clients, I told him he could charge more, probably a lot more.  
  
  I helped him think about it as the company needs him a lot more than he needs that company, and there will always be more clients for his skillset. 
  
 He thought about it and told me he might go for $3500 a month. I told him to go for $5000. 
  
  He messaged me later saying he signed them for $4500 per month, $2000 more than his average. 
  
  You don’t know what you can get until you ask for it. This applies to jobs, rates, promotions, and pretty much everything else. Desirable things aren’t often handed to you. You earn them, and it will feel amazing when you go out and get what you deserve.
