We have two spots left in our July Freelance Bootcamp that kicks off July 6th!  
  
  We cover everything you need to launch your freelance business, from the tactical aspects of setting up your business correctly, to writing an impactful proposal, setting your rate, and scoping out projects, to more strategic aspects such as executive coaching, personal branding, and negotiation. 
  
  I also share stories from my freelance life, including how I changed a $5k budget into a $21,000 project, and how I earned more than my Uber salary in half the number of hours. 
  
  If you're interested in hearing more, comment below and I'll DM you!
