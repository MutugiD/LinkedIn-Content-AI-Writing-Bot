As business winds down towards the end of this year, it's an incredible time for self reflection. 
  
  It starts with as simple as: what parts of my work life do I like the most? And then, what parts do I not like? 
  
  There are no right or wrong answers, it's whatever feels genuine to you. 
  
  But this is the time to take a step back and ask yourself if you're really doing work you love, with people you care about, in an environment that suits you. Do you feel fully valued? Are you on a path that challenges you where you have an opportunity to reach your potential? 
  
  Depending on how you answer those questions, it's time to think about how you will make some changes in 2023, keeping the parts you love and changing what you don't. 
  
  And if any part of that plan includes working for yourself and growing your independent business, hit me up - I'd love to chat with you.
