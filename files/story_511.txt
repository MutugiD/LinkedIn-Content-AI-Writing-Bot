I went from making under $50 / hr as the Head of Carrier Operations at Uber Freight, to over $250 / hr working for myself as a consultant. 
  
  Overnight.  
  
  Here's how that math shakes out: 
  
  Uber 
  -60 hour weeks (being generous) 
  -48 weeks per year 
  -$41.67 / hour 
  -$120k annual salary 
  
  Consulting 
  -$250/ hr 
  -25 hours per week 
  -$25k / month ($275k salary working 11 months per year at 25 hours per week) 
  
  So I made 129% the annual salary in 41.7% of the hours worked at 6x the hourly rate. 
  
  Remind me why I'd go back to corporate again?
