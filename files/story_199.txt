There's no one right way to find your first consulting client. But there are plenty of options. 
  
  Here are 5 proven methods that work: 
  
  1. Network with past colleagues and managers - they know you, they know your work, and can hire you for a project on the spot 
  
  2. Network with a wider net - starting with previous coworkers is excellent, but don’t stop there. Reach out to friends, family, and professionals at other companies or in other fields. Have conversations. Be curious. You never know where it can lead. 
  
  3. Link your consulting niche on LinkedIn - get a simple website that communicates your consulting value (mine is here: https://mylance.co/bradley) and link it from your LinkedIn. Your LinkedIn gets dozens of hits per day. Give them an opportunity to see your consulting niche, and you might get inbounds 
  
  4. Share your thoughts on social (LinkedIn is best followed by Twitter) - you don’t need tens of thousands of social media followers to begin generating business. Even a few hundred dedicated followers can turn into leads if they fit your target audience. Share insights from past projects or jobs, changes to your industry, and other ideas that convey your niche expertise. Do not sell. Share information. Not only does this keep you top-of-mind for your followers, but it reinforces your expertise. 
  
  5. Partner with existing consultants - they have clients and work, and often are looking for people to team up with. Further, they see opportunities in other niches at their existing clients that might fit you. Join a community (like Mylance) that has talented freelancers with similar backgrounds
