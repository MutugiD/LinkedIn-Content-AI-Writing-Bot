I did it!  
  
  After 4.5 years at Uber in Operations, I quit my job to go out on my own. 
  
  This is what I would've written in Oct 2018. 
  
  Here's how the next 18 months played out: 
  
  I wanted to start a company. But I didn't have an idea I was passionate about.  
  
  I wondered if I could work part-time that would pay my bills while I figured out what company I'd start. 
  
  I didn't know how to find a client. But, I figured I'd do some outreach and see what happened. 
  
  I reached out to the last 11 hiring managers / recruiters that had messaged me on LinkedIn. 
  
  I was very honest with them: I told them I wasn't open to full-time, but that I could add value part-time given my experiences at Uber. 
  
  10 of them ignored me or said  no. 
  
  But 1 was open to it. 
  
  We jumped on a call. 
  
  After an interview and a proposal, I had my first client. They paid me $250 / hr for 25 hours per week ($25k / mo). 
  
  I couldn't believe it. It felt too good to be true. 
  
  It wasn't. Over the next 18 months I'd find over a dozen clients, all paying me a similar rate. 
  
  I became incredibly passionate about part-time work and helping others do it. 
  
  So I founded Mylance to empower professionals to monetize their experience and make money on the size. 
  
  We've helped over 1,000+ professionals launch and grow consulting businesses, many doing well over $20k / month. 
  
  It's been hard and fulfilling and everything in between. 
  
  We're now working on a lead generation engine for consultants to find their next client, and have a vetted, vibrant community of professionals all pushing the boundaries of work. 
  
  Stay tuned for what comes next!
