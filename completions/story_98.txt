The ability to go solo and become a freelancer or solopreneur offers its own set of challenges, but it can also deliver great rewards. With 44% of independent consultants saying they earn more than with a traditional job, and the flexibility and ownership being unparalleled, it's no wonder more people are opting out of working for others and striking out on their own. Mylance provides the community, resources, templates, and support that help get solopreneurs off the ground and succeed. Plus, an upcoming lead generation engine will make it even easier for freelancers to reach their own level of success.
