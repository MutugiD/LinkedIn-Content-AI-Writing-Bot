PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

The difference between a $5k project and $20k project can come down to two simple things: 
    
  1. You asked for $20k 
  2. You have a refined, concise niche where the client sees value 
    
  To close high-paying projects you genuinely enjoy, you need a curated niche that’s concise, tangible, and effective. 
    
  Most professionals struggle with this, even marketing professionals! You're not alone, and we're here to help. You need a one sentence statement that just hits. 
  
  Over hundreds of customer calls, I’ve learned the best way to help you navigate this, it's one of biggest value-adds of the Accelerator. 
  
    
  You can think about it like this: 
  If you could picture your ideal client, the one company or individual that if they found YOU, they’d say “oh my, this is incredible, I need you working on my company NOW.” What is that situation for you? 
    
  
  Let me give an example to make this more tangible. For me, I had launched Uber Eats in Miami and Milan. So when a self-driving company was looking to launch a food delivery marketplace and got in contact with me, it was a no-brainer for them. 
    
  
  I had the playbook, I had done it twice successfully, and I could help them avoid expensive and time-intensive mistakes. When I told them about my experience and what it was like to launch those markets, I’m pretty sure I could have pitched them nearly any monthly rate and they would’ve accepted. 
    
  
  They NEEDED my experience. (And they were super well-funded, so they could afford a high rate!) 
    
  
  Let’s bring this back to you. Who’s that client for you? What is the situation they’re in where if they found you, they’d jump out of their chair in excitement, and beg you to help them? 
    
  
  While not every client you have is going to fit that category, this is how you find your niche. 
  
  I’ve now updated my HQ, because my superpower is helping YOU refine your niche into one powerful sentence.

RESPONSE:

It's essential for professionals to have a concrete niche that will enable them to close high-paying projects they'd enjoy working on. Refining a niche into a single, powerful statement can be tricky - but it is possible! For example, my niche was launching Uber Eats in Miami and Milan, and the client wanted to launch a food delivery marketplace. The same can be true for professionals in any field - by understanding their superpower, they can capture their ideal client's attention and make an impact. With the right approach, high-paying projects and joy-filled work are possible!
