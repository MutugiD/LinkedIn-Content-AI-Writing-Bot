I got the cool opportunity to launch Uber Eats in Miami. After a successful launch Uber asked me to interview for the Miami GM position - the dream job for me at the time. 
  
  After one round of interviews, I got rejected.  
  
  Of course the natural question to ask is: what did I do wrong? What could I have done better to get the role? 
  
  I later found out: not much. It was my resume that held me back. They wanted an MBA. They wanted more managerial experience. 
  
  It didn't matter that I had managed multiple teams already at Uber. And it didn't matter that I had just facilitated one of the best launches Uber Eats had seen to date. They had their criteria, and they stuck to it. 
  
  I was dejected and frustrated. It had been my dream to be a GM at Uber. But, it wasn't going to happen at that time.  
  
  As I tried to get another GM role, I got some tough feedback: don't go in asking for a position because you want it or it's good for you. A company hires you or promotes you because it will help THEM. The pitch needs to be about them. 
  
  So I used this feedback. I told the team I could use my experience help THEM launch new markets in Europe. And that's exactly what they let me do. And then I got this incredible experience going to Amsterdam, Madrid, and Milan launching Uber Eats. 
  
  Rejection is hard. It sucks. Nobody likes it. But, after you digest the  hurt  that comes with it, it's an opportunity. To learn from the experience. And to get a new experience. And you never know where that new experience might take you.
