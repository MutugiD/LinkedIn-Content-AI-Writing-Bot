Getting really excited as we prepare for our June 1 Freelance Consulting Bootcamp. Currently writing up the timeline for how you close your first consulting client, and what you should be thinking each step of the way. Here's a preview: 
  
  1. Make a connection 
  Some kind of validation, either a mutual connection vouches for you, or at least you communicate your accomplishments and experiences so they’re excited to talk to you. 
  
  2. Jump on a call (or two) 
  Get to know each other, build a rapport, and ask great questions about their business in your area of expertise. Get a full understanding of their business through your questions while throwing in some thoughts to pique their interest and validate your expertise. Find out the decision maker to hire someone, their willingness to pay cash and their budget for this project, and how big of a challenge your area of expertise is to their business 
  
  4. Send over a proposal 
  Communicate your value again, summarize the company’s challenges using as many of their words as possible, and define how you’ll solve their challenges. 
  
  5. Negotiate terms 
  Remember they need you more than you need them. Go in with a specific starting point (e.g., $2470 per week for 10 hours) and know what you’re willing to go down to (both in rate and hours per week)
