I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

Nothing is given to you in the professional world. Even with an incredible boss, the only person looking out for you is you. 
  
  For me, this came in two parts: 
  
  1. Knowing what I wanted 
  2. Asking for and in some cases pushing hard to take steps in that direction 
  
  My favorite anecdote for this is after I launched UberEATS in Miami, Uber told me I didn't have enough experience to be a GM. So, I decided to get more launch experience, and I'd always wanted to work abroad.  
  
  I knew Uber was launching EATS in Europe, so I went on the internal job board, and applied to be the UberEATS GM in Madrid. Mind you, I'm not fluent in Spanish and there was no way they'd give me this role.  
  
  BUT, it got me on the phone with the recruiter where I told them I'd just successfully launched Miami, and I could help with Europe. She got me in touch with the Regional General Manager and after a quick conversation, they asked me to get on a plane to Amsterdam to help with the Europe launches. 
  
  A few weeks after getting there, they tasked me with launching Milan UberEATS, and helping with Madrid.  
  
  There was no JD. There was no  launch UberEATS in Milan  role. I knew what I wanted, and I pushed to make it happen. 
  
  Ask for what you want and fight for it when necessary. Agree? Disagree? Comment below!

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story.
