I've managed 9 markets in the North Carolinas for Uber Rides. 
  
  I launched Uber Eats in Miami and Milan. 
  
  I launched and ran Carrier Operations for Uber Freight in the US. 
  
  I quit my job at Uber and contracted with Seed and Series A companies for $25k / mo in 25 hours per week as an independent consultant. 
  
  I founded Mylance and have grown it to $40k / mo building the infrastructure and community for other talented consultants.
