PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

The FULL story of how I got my first $25k / month consulting client: 
  
  Once I quit Uber and took a little bit of time off, I was ready to start working on what was next. I wanted to start a company. But I didn’t know what I wanted to start.  
  
  I also wondered how I was going to support myself. I couldn’t just keep going without income. I considered if I could help out companies part-time. So, I did some outreach. Or rather, I responded to some LinkedIn inbound recruiters and hiring managers. 
  
  I responded to each of them honestly that I was willing to help them part-time.  
  
  Here’s a sample note I sent: 
  
  Thanks for reaching out. I definitely think my 4 years at Uber could be helpful as AutoX rolls out their self-driving marketplace. Do you see an opportunity for me to help as more of an advisor than a full-time role? I'm currently not in the market for a full-time role, but am open to other arrangements. Let me know your thoughts.  
  
  Cheers, 
  Bradley 
  
  I sent out 12 notes like this. 11 times I got a “no” or just no response. 
  
  One of the 12, however, responded positively back that they were down to get on a call and chat. 
  
  I had my first lead. I didn’t call them leads at that time. I didn’t know anything.  
  
  I jumped on a call with them and talked about my experience at Uber, and inquired about their needs.  
  
  They asked me to send over a proposal of what a working arrangement could look like. I didn’t have a template or any kind of idea what this could look like. So I did what any business minded person does best. I made a deck that included: 
  
  1. My background 
  2. The terms of the agreement including my rate 
  3. The challenges I understood facing the company 
  4. The questions I expected to address 
  5. A sample food delivery marketplace business model 
  
  I sent it over. 
  
  I guess they liked it, because they invited me onsite for an interview (this was long before COVID was an issue). I spoke to a few different members of their team including the CEO and COO. 
  
  I got a call a few days later from the recruiter that they’d like to offer me the contract, but that my rate was a bit too high. 
  
  I had made up some random number calculating my Uber salary, projected equity, added in a huge buffer for health insurance and other contractor costs, and divided by 40 hours per week and 49 weeks per year.  
  
  It came out to $267 per hour. This felt high, but what did I have to lose?  
  
  So when the phone call came in and told me my rate was too high, I got nervous. I couldn’t really defend that rate. But I did something that in hindsight was smart: I asked them to counter. They countered at $250 / hr (only 7% lower than what I’d asked for). I accepted on the spot. Deal.  
  
  While the contract was hourly, if I worked 20 hours per week I’d make $20k per month, and at 25 hours per week, I’d make $25k per month. 
  
  Score! 
  
  I had my first consulting client. And it changed my life forever.  
  
  If you want a copy of the deck I sent over, add a comment below and I'll send it over to you!

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story. 

SUMMARY: 




==========

RESPONSE:

I had only recently quit Uber and was unsure of what to do next. After going through the daunting task of responding to recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn, I finally got one positive response from a company that was willing to get on a call with me. 

I created a deck that showcased my skills and understanding of their challenges and proposed an arrangement for advisory services, which the company found appealing. After responding to their counteroffer of $250 per hour, I found myself with my first consulting client. At 25 hours a week, I was now making $25k/month! It was a moment that changed my life and trajectory forever.
