I have a saved text that clearly communicates my experience in my niche that wins me consulting clients.  
  
  I end up using it ALL THE TIME. I'll share it below. 
  
  It took me a while to come up with. It's not super easy. I iterated on it for months. 
  
  But now that I have it, I use it to: 
  
  1. Get $1,000/hr expert network calls 
  2. Become advisors to early stage start-ups 
  3. Attract and close consulting clients 
  
  For my Freight experience, here's my blurb: 
  
  I managed the Carrier Operations team for Uber Freight for nearly two years from our launch in January 2017 through October 2018, and have since been consulting for companies in the logistics and Freight space.  
  
  At Uber Freight, I built up the operations team, and played a key role in the initial strategy and operations. I became the Head of Carrier Operations, and in this role I shaped the direction of Uber Freightâ€™s Carrier Strategy as it related to carrier acquisition and engagement, and played a key role in marketplace dynamics, pricing, product prioritization, and service expansion decisions.  
  
  Given that experience, and my current work with technology start-ups in the Freight and logistics space, I can speak to the Freight landscape, the impact on technology and tech start-ups in the space, and my best guess to what it will look like over the next 3-5 years.  
  
  It's incredibly effective and while it took me a while to come up with, it's paid for itself MANY times over.
