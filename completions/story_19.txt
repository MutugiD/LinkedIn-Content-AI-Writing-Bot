Uber's remarkable success was largely due to the company's resonance with unified goal that transcended the geographical boundaries and unified thousands of employees under one mission. With Travis Kalanick's inspirational leadership and strong communication, everyone from the Operations Manager to the weekly team meetings was dedicated to working hard to accomplish this goal. Uber's growth was a testament to the power of vision, leadership, communication, and alignment in any organization.
