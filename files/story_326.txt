Starting a company had always been a dream of mine. I started a company in college with a few friends that never got off the ground. I started multiple blogs, launched landing pages, and started another business with friends a few years ago. Nothing stuck. I didn't follow through. 
  
  September 1st 2019, I decided enough was enough. I put my head down to start my own business around a problem and customer I truly cared about.  
  
  No matter how hard it was, I kept moving forward. Every day, another step forward. I took a vague idea and ran with it. I picked a name, bought a domain, incorporated, and got to work. 
  
  There's no right time to start a business. There's rarely that  great idea.  There's just grit, hustle, and hard work. 
  
  Two years ago I started with an idea and ambition. And today I sit here with an incredible team, customers I truly care about, and an exciting product about to launch that helps people work for themselves, find clients, and live a flexible, fulfilling life. 
  
  I'm proud, but I also write this to tell you that you can do it too. It's not easy, but it is incredibly rewarding. If you've always wanted to start a business, there's no better time to put your head down and get started.
