I thought launching Uber Eats in various cities prepared me for starting my own company. 
  
  I couldn’t have been more wrong. 
  
  First, at Uber I had access to incredible resources. The biggest one being Uber’s talent pool. I had the guidance of a GM. Help from the pricing team. Our PR team got us newspaper and radio placements. 
  
  And most importantly, I could pull Operations and Marketing talent from the cities teams to help us launch. This could not be more different when it’s your own company and you have to go find (and pay for!) great talent. 
  
  Second and most importantly, when launching a new city for Uber, the product already had product market fit. Sure it was still a ton of effort, late nights, and hustle to launch the city, but the product was proven. 
  
  If we followed the playbook well and customize it for our city, we’d success, and we knew how to grow the business unit (referrals, some paid marketing, and tons of organic “word of mouth” worked for Uber). 
  
  With my own company, I have to do EVERYTHING from scratch, starting with forming an entity, finding lawyers to help me issue equity and set things up properly, coming up with a not horrible name, building and launching a website, and finding money to fund all of that before anything has actually happened! 
  
  Once that’s all done, I need to find product market fit. This means doing tons of customer interviews and coming up with solutions. And once I have solutions, I need to test those solutions while still serving existing customers and keeping everything else afloat. 
  
  While I learned a ton and got an incredible experience launching Uber Eats in Miami and Milan, it paled in comparison to actually launching my own thing! Nothing can adequately prepare you for that. 
  
  My tip: make sure you have a support system (I got a team of advisors) and are really in love with the problem you’re solving - there’s no shortcuts along the way.
