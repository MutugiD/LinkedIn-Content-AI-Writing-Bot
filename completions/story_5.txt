When Uber and Lyft both descended upon Raleigh in 2014, nobody could have predicted the outcome. Six months later, Uber had a staggering 90% market share in the area. How did they do it? Here are 4 key strategies. 

First, they kept their focus tight. Instead of trying to cover the entire region, Uber opted to launch within a 7-mile radius around downtown Raleigh - the area with the highest demand. This allowed them to match drivers and riders better and keep ETAs under 5 minutes, their primary goal at the time. 

Second, Uber used targeted incentives to get more drivers on the road. They tapped into data to identify peak hours and then offered additional financial incentives to drivers who were willing to work during those times. 

Third, Uber’s local city teams gave them an advantage over Lyft, which was based in San Francisco and ran operations from there. Uber’s local teams allowed them to be more agile and respond to local events and trends quickly, while also building stronger relationships with riders and drivers in the area. 

Finally, Uber focused on quality over quantity. While Lyft spread its wings into neighboring cities like Durham and Chapel Hill, Uber stayed focused on perfecting the rider and driver experience in their core market. They worked closely with drivers to address concerns and feedback, and made sure every support ticket was attended to promptly. 

The takeaway is simple: don't try to do too much too soon. Focus on your core market, listen to your customers, and execute your plan flawlessly.
