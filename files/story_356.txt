A few months into my consulting career I made a decision that completely changed how I ran my business.  
  
  I found a partner with a completely different skillset to collaborate with me. He was in marketing and business development. I'm in operations, launch, and strategy. I like to call him  the relationship guy.   
  
  While we were completely different, it made for an incredible partnership. The BD side of consulting was never my favorite. I loved delivering on projects, but finding the clients and maintaining the relationship wasn't my forte.  
  
  But he loved it, and he'd set up calls and introductions every week with new potential clients for us. 
  
  I can't say I ever saw myself working with him because of how different we were, and yet it turned out to be the best partnership I could've asked for.  
  
  Collaborating on clients also helped me feel less  alone  in my journey, and I genuinely enjoyed working together.  
  
  Even as I run Mylance now, we're still incredibly close and helping each other out where we can.  
  
  You never know where someone will come into your life and surprise you, the key is to be open to it and let it happen.
