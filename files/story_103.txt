If you pitch yourself as an “Operations expert,” nobody has any idea what you do.  
  
  Here’s what to do instead: 
  
  Your goal is to have your expertise be in the top 1% so you can differentiate yourself and command high rates.  
  
  You also want a client to easily understand your value-add in 1-2 sentences. 
  
  If you market yourself as an “Operations Expert” you won't stand out and a client can't differentiate your skillset. 
  
  You might have varied experience and consider yourself a generalist. And maybe you are. But we can’t pitch you like that.  
  
  We need to narrow in on our niche and differentiate ourselves. 
  
  To do this, consider what you’ve actually done in your career. The highlights. Your proudest accomplishments.  
  
  Let's use a growth marketing example. 
  
  You didn’t accomplish “growth marketing.” You nailed down the marketing channels and defined a strategy for each one to enable your start-up to scale. 
  
  Use simple terms. Make it easy to understand. 
  
  Once you have that, brainstorm whom you do that for. Do you do it for environmental non-profits? Seed stage fin-tech start-ups? Publicly traded marketplaces? Get specific. 
  
  Now, combine those two.  
  
  “I find the best marketing channels for your Seed stage, Fintech start-up, and execute the strategy for each one.”  
  
  Now I know what you do, and if I have that need, I’m going to hire you, not the “growth marketer.”
