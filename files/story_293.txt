Kicked off a great January 2022 Mylance Accelerator today with an incredibly talented group of individuals.  
  
  Three notables that stood out to me: 
  
  -Regardless of how much experience someone has, going out on your own is scary and filled with anxiety. People want and need support into the unknown and uncertainty 
  
  -Finding a niche is an incredibly challenging exercise. You need one to find high paying clients, but most are resistant to the idea of distilling down their value-add to a one sentence niche 
  
  -An objective third party makes a huge difference in helping someone see their blindspots and point out an alternate perspective that could change their life 
  
  I feel privileged and fulfilled helping these talented folks achieve their dreams of working for themselves and enabling them to support their passions, whatever those might be!
