You've worked your butt off for your experiences and your skills. The value you add to a company or individual is higher than you think. 
  
  Don't work for free, or take a lower rate than you feel comfortable.  
  
  Stand up for yourself, get a rate you feel comfortable with, or feel free to say  no.   
  
  Saying  no  to a bad deal is better than agreeing to a client that under pays and undervalues you. 
  
  And remember, don't work for free!
