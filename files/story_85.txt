Every consulting project I've ever heard of started with a meeting to discuss the company and its challenges. 
  
  Of course, you're optimizing for calls with qualified clients who need you AND have the ability to pay you. One without the other is useless; you need BOTH of those criteria to be met. 
  
  Then, you need to be reaching out to contacts daily.  
  
  Some will say  no  or ignore you. That's part of the game. 
  
  But plenty will say  yes  and book that call with you. And that's your opportunity to understand their challenges to see if you can help them. 
  
  When you combine volume outreach with quality outreach, you win.  
  
  I know this is time-consuming. I did it myself and I hear it from our customers:  outreach is a full-time job! 
  
  Which is why we've been working hard to develop a lead gen tool customized for your consulting business and powered by AI. And we're almost ready! 
  
  We'll be giving access to our beta customers soon. If you're interested in early access, join our waitlist (link in the comments!)
