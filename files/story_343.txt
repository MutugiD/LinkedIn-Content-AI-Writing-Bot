A few years ago, a consulting project landed in my lap. It was great, and I felt lucky. But it wasn't totally by coincidence: I had let my network know (via LinkedIn!) that I was consulting independently.  
  
  Turns out that's one of the most basic things to do if you want to pick up a consulting project: update your LinkedIn with the value you offer to companies.  
  
  This doesn't mean you post HEY EVERYONE I'M CONSULTING HIRE ME HIRE ME!  
  
  It means sharing your area of expertise and how you add value.  
  
  This gives your network an opportunity to reach out to YOU about a project.  
  
  Once I started letting my network know via LinkedIn that I was consulting independently, I got a few folks from my past (some from YEARS ago) reaching out asking if I could help them. You never know who might come back and offer you a $20,000 project from your past!
