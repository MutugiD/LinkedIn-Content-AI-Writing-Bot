I have some really exciting news:  
  
  I got promoted! 
  
  
  Okay, I didn't technically get promoted.  
  
  But it dawned on me: as a founder, I might never  get promoted  again. 
  
  While that's technically true, I can see and feel how much I've grown as a founder, a leader, and a peer to my colleagues.  
  
  And I want to celebrate that! 
  
  So while I still have the same title and still make a very bare-bones salary, I'd like to celebrate the growth I've had, the new skills I've acquired, and the areas I've improved. 
  
  And if you're a founder or solopreneur, I'd like to invite you to promote yourself and celebrate yourself along with me!
