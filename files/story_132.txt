“Cold outreach is dead.” 
  
  I’m seeing this everywhere, yet I just responded to a cold outreach on LinkedIn yesterday. 
  
  What made me respond? 
  
  He did two things really well: 
  
  1. His language spoke to me. He resonated with a “pain” that I’m feeling. Maybe it’s a good guess. But I think he’s done his research, knows his niche and ideal client, and thus used words that other founders have used in the past. 
  
  2. He validated himself through his past work. He showcased experience that I’d benefit from and would be excited to hear more about. 
  
  So I responded, and booked a call. 
  
  I don’t know if I’ll end up working with him, but he got my attention, and now he has a lead for his consulting business. 
  
  Cold outreach isn’t dead.  
  
  The bar is just higher.
