How you approach getting your first client is what separates those who get first clients easily, versus those who don’t. 
  
  I found my first client through LinkedIn when a Series A company reached out to me for a full-time role. I politely told them I wasn’t interested in a full-time role, and asked if they’d be open to leveraging my experience in a part-time capacity. It turns out they had reached out to dozens of other ex-Uber folks before me. I was just the first to ask for what I wanted. 
  
  Three key pro-tips to help you get your first client:  
  
  1. Communicate what you’re offering, clearly. 
  2. Remind yourself: you have what it takes! 
  3. Just ask! Questions lead to opportunities. 
    
  1. Do the work to know what you can offer and be able to communicate what your skills and offerings are, clearly. And be specific: “I specialize in bringing together two and three-sided, B2B and B2B marketplaces” resonates a lot more with a potential client than “I work in Operations.”
