If you just got laid off and you're sick of working for someone else, read this: 
  
  1. You were getting paid good money to work full-time. You have great experience and an expertise that you bring to the table, and you can 100% get paid part-time to consult for companies. 
  
  2. I know this because I’m doing it. After working in Operations at Uber for 4 years, I left and started consulting, earning $25k / month in 25 hours per week. I’ve been doing it for 5 years now.  
  
  
  3. By working for someone else, you weren’t capturing your full value. They have to pay you less than you produce for the company. As a part-time expert, you can capture a much higher percentage of that value. 
  
  4. To do this well, you need a clear and refined niche. You’re not “a marketing expert.” Instead, you “build funnels for DTC ecommerce brands to improve their conversion.” Be specific. Be concrete.  
  
  5. Once you have a niche, you need an ideal customer. Who needs your expertise? And who has the ability to pay you? Using our example from above, your ideal customer could be an established DTC Ecommerce brand doing $500k+ in revenue on Shopify.  
  
  6. Now we need to get on the phone with them. If we schedule 20 calls with our ideal customer, we’re going to land our first client. So, how do we get calls? We can research those companies, find out who runs them, and reach out.  
  
  7. Be curious about their business and ask good questions. You’ll establish your expertise by asking these questions and they’ll be interested in working with you. 
  
  8. Set your rate, send over a proposal, negotiate by listening to their side and being curious, and close. 
  
  9. And now you have your first client! Repeat 2-3 more times and you’ve already replaced your W2 income!
