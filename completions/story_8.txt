When I left Uber, I had no idea what my next step should be. I had no idea if it was even possible to take on a part-time consulting job. But I decided to take a shot in the dark and responded to 12 companies, letting them know I was open to consulting on a part-time basis. 

Out of the 12 companies, only one responded favorably and asked to talk further. It was that one company that ended up becoming my first consulting client. 

Sometimes, you just have to go out and try. You may not hit the bullseye every time, but you increase your chances of success by putting yourself out there. You won't know what's possible until you ask for it. 

Take the leap and see what happens. You only have something to gain. #justtryit #putyourselfoutthere #makeithappen
