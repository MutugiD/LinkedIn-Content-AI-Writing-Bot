Imposter syndrome is something that nearly everyone faces. Our very own Austin Bauer (he/him) wrote about it today in our newsletter.  
  
  Here's a snippet below, and the full article in the comments. 
    
  Fear and imposter syndrome. Fear never goes away, it only gets managed. Anyone who is in a leadership position and doesn't feel some fear is either lying to themselves or lying to others.  
  
  Imposter syndrome is extremely common, and not just for newer consultants. It causes people to doubt their accomplishments while facing a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud. It’s amazing how many smart, talented, hard-working people tell themselves, “I’m just lucky,” or “anyone can do what I’ve done.” This is rarely objectively true. We tend to downplay our own accomplishments, which holds us back. 
  
  Two things are key to combating fear and imposter syndrome. First, it helps to know that almost everyone faces these fears. That alone can be enough to let us move forward with less self-doubt. Second, it helps to see our accomplishments through others’ eyes. Simply hearing someone else read our resume aloud can help us to see ourselves in a new light.
