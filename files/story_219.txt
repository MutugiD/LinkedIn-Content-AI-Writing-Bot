Common questions (and my answers) I get on customer calls: 
  
  Can I consult alongside a full-time job 
  -Yes, absolutely 
  
  Is 10 hours per week enough to consult? 
  -For sure 
  
  Do I have enough experience to consult? 
  -Yes, you do 
  
  Do I have to be a good sales(wo)man to consult? 
  -No, you don't. You just have to communicate your value well 
  
  Is there a world in which I don't deliver for my clients? 
  -Probably not. That's your inner imposter voice talking to you 
  
  Is there a better time to start given I have so much going on right now? 
  -You tell me. How long have you wanted this? Is fear holding you back? Your business won't launch itself and if you don't take the time and make the investment, you might always be saying  not right now. 
  
  What's required to get my first client? 
  -Take the leap. Hone your niche. Put yourself out there. Ask for your value.
