When I left Uber, I wasn't sure what could be possible for me. Taking a chance, I put myself out there and responded to 12 companies, 11 saying no and the last one resulting in my first consulting client. I learned that nothing is ever going to happen if you don't try, and sometimes the bigger loss is not even giving yourself a chance. #justtryit #putyourselfoutthere #makeithappen
