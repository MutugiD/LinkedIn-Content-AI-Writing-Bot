I founded Mylance 2.5 years ago. If I were to re-launch Mylance today, here are the first 4 things Iâ€™d do to get it off the ground: 
  
  
  
  1. Talk to as many of my target customers as possible. Ask open-ended questions about their pain points, record the calls, listen intently and take notes. 
  
  2. Launch a landing page with a free offer (e.g., a newsletter, community, playbook, etc.) surrounding what I heard from the customer interviews and start collecting emails. 
  
  3. As I collected the emails, jump on a call with each customer to further validate their needs. 
  
  4. Start a community (so I could talk to more customers) and sell a product to solve one of their biggest needs. 
  
  Note: I wouldn't need to actually have built this product already. I'm just validating that they'd pay for it if I did have it. 
  
  Validation first. Product building second. 
  
  Founders: would you offer any tweaks to the above?
