Back in 2019 (pre-COVID!) I was in New York visiting family and working from a co-working space. It turns out, the co-working space was actually an early stage start-up that was turning restaurant spaces into co-working spaces during the day. 
  
  Given how small the company was, the Head of Operations of the company happened to be there, and sponsored a Happy Hour for the folks working there.  
  
  I was curious about their business, and so I went over to talk to him. We got to chatting about the company, how they'd originally tested their model, and I started asking questions about how they were thinking about expansion, launch, and scale.  
  
  As I asked curious questions, I dove into areas where I'd become an expert at Uber. I asked questions and listened intently to his answers. As we went on, he started to have fewer thoughts about the deeper areas, and eventually turned it around on me, asking me what I thought they could do.  
  
  This was the perfect entry - I could answer his question, reference my Uber launch and scaling experience, and help him think about how he'd scale the business efficiently. 
  
  Afterwards, he gave me his card and told me to email him to set up time to talk to see if we could work something out. 
  
  You never know who you'll meet or how a conversation will go. Whether it's with an old friend, past manager, or stranger at a co-working space, asking curious questions around your area of expertise does a better job  selling  than any sales pitch you'll ever try.
