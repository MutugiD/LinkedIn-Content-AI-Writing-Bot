It's amazing how easy it can be to help someone else with their problems, and how challenging it can be to see your own situation objectively and solve your own problems. 
  
  Lean on your support system for help. And give back to them when they need you.  
  
  When I talk to interested Bootcamp customers, I always try to give advice and help them. Regardless of whether they sign-up for the Bootcamp, they have a positive impression of me and Mylance and often will refer a friend or join us down the line.
