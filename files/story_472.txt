The #1 way I find and convert consulting gigs is really simple and anyone can do it.  
  
  I don't sell myself. I don't pitch. I simply ask good, thoughtful questions. 
  
  Asking good questions shows your client that you understand their business, you understand their business's needs, you're thoughtful, you have relevant experience, and you can relate to what they're going through. I've been offered consulting gigs I wasn't even looking for just because I was interested in someone else's business. 
  
  Try it next time and see what happens!
