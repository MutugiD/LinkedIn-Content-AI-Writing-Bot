Taking any leap is hard because of the unknown. It's so much easier to stay in your current situation than do something about it and make a change.  
  
  What if I fail?   
  What happens next? 
  What skills do I have?   
  What if it doesn't work out? 
  
  Sometimes, it takes people getting laid off or fired to take that leap because they're forced to.  
  
  Many times, this ends up creating an opportunity. An opportunity to step back and say, what do I really want to do? What am I passionate about? What am I going to spend 60% of my waking hours doing? 
  
  Those questions can turn into: 
  
  What do I get to work on now? 
  How can I take my skills and make an impact on more people? 
  What have I always wanted to do or learn? 
  
  Framing for yourself is critical, even if that means taking the time off and let your mind rest.
