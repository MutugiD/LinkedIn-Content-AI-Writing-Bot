I started Mylance out of a desire to help people experience the independent consulting life that I loved after I left Uber.  
  
  After months of learning and iterating, I've developed a 4 week bootcamp that walks through everything you need to know about freelance consulting. This includes how to find your niche, optimize your business for taxes, set your pricing, scope out projects, find and close clients, in addition to proposal and contract templates.  
  
  You'll leave the course with the materials and knowledge to start freelancing immediately, saving you ~6 months of learning on your own. Further, you're a part of the Mylance community forever. 
  
  The measure of success is that you're equipped and able to close your first client, whether that happens during the bootcamp or months after.  
  
  I'm already incredibly impressed with the caliber of folks in our June 1st cohort. We have a few slots left, so if you have strong professional experience and are interested, shoot us a note before the May 23rd deadline! 
  
  I know this is a tough time for many, so if this isn't the right time for you and you need a break, we'll likely be doing this again in July!
