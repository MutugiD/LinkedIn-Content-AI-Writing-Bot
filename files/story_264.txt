Free advice: it's a problem for every consultant. You start talking to a potential client or even a former colleague, and they want to  pick your brain  about a topic you're an expert in. 
  
  You're torn. You want to help them. But you also don't want to work for free. 
  
  The advice you have to share is from years worth of learning, mistakes, and hard work. Giving it away for free feels like robbery! 
  
  Here's how I've thought about it: 
  
  Let's be thoughtful with free knowledge. People will take as much free advice as we give them.  
  
  We can use free advice to validate ourselves to them on an intro call, and then USE the rest of our advice to encourage them to agree to a  formal arrangement  (a consulting gig) and get paid for that advice! 
  
  
  You can use the following language to help transition from a free call to a paid consulting project 
  
  “Hey thanks so much for reaching out. I’m flattered that you value my experience. I’m happy to come up with a formal arrangement with you and then share anything that would be helpful to grow your business. Does that work?” 
  
  What other tactics have you used to pivot from free advice to a paid gig?
