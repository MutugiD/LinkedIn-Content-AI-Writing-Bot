We have 2 options for how we work: 
  
  1. We can listen to everyone else around us. How we were brought up, what we're  supposed  to do. We could work for someone else, 9-5, and not question a thing. We'd be fine. 
  
  Or 
  
  2. We can ask questions. Challenge the status quo.  What do I really want to do?   Can I work in a more flexible way and still meet my goals?   What am I really passionate about?  What would it take for me to really enjoy work? 
  
  For me, I did #1 for the first 6 years of my career. I learned a ton and grew a lot. And then I started to ask questions.  
  
  And I decided I wanted to work for myself. And since then, I've consulting, sold a course, bought and sold an ecommerce business, started a tech company, and made more money than when I had a  stable  full-time job. 
  
  The choice is yours. Own your situation. Make a conscious choice. And whatever you're doing, know that it's 100% up to you.
