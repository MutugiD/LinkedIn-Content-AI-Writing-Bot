An important reminder: past success does not guarantee future success. 
  
  Launching Uber markets is hard and it feels like starting a business from scratch, but it's not at all. It's taking a proven model and implementing it in a new market. Scaling Uber was more like taking a business from 1 to 10, not from 0 to 1. 
  
  Starting a business is a completely different ballgame. It’s incredibly challenging and many days slaps me in the face.
