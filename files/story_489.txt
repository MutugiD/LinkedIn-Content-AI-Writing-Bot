It turns out I was making ~$32 an hour (on a 6 figure salary!) as an Ops GM at Uber in 2018. 
  
  In October 2018, I quit Uber, and immediately 7x'd my hourly rate.  
  
  That's not a typo. I went to $250 / hour, meaning by working 25 hours per week (38% of the time of my full-time Uber job), I was making 3x as much money. 
  
  These are real numbers.  
  
  I started Mylance to empower impressive professionals like you work for yourself, and earn your true value in the market all with the flexibility and freedom of being your own boss.
