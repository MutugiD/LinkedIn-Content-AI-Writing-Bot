The end of the year gives us an opportunity to step back and reflect: 
  
  Am I where I want to be? 
  
  Am I doing what I want to be doing? 
  
  What changes would I like to make going into 2023? 
  
  As we approach the end of the year, we're seeing demand for Mylance's offers pick up. More and more professionals are looking to monetize their experience as part-time experts. 
  
  I founded Mylance because I fell in love with part-time work and what it affords: ownership over your work, complete flexibility, time for passions, time for family, closing the gender pay gap, and more.
