The honest truth is most professionals are horrible at packaging their experience into a concise 1-sentence summary of what they do.  
  
  Here's why it's so important to get right: 
  
  1. First impressions matter: how we present ourselves makes a material impact on how another person perceives us. 
  
  2. Attention spans have never been shorter. We have less than 30 seconds to pique someone's interest, whether they're talking to us, reading our resume, or browsing our personal website. 
  
  3. Global talent is more accessible than ever before, meaning competition is greater. We need to be in the top 1% of what we do so we stand out for a particular need, and still get high paying (5-figure per month) retainers. 
  
  4. It projects confidence. It shows clarity in your offering and your skillset, bringing confidence to the table. Confidence plays a huge role in getting that high figure salary or consulting gig, and cannot be understated.  
  
  We use our 1-2 sentence  niche  in numerous places: 
  
  1. At the start of every networking or intro call 
  2. To headline our proposals 
  3. On our personal websites or Mylance HQs 
  4. To headline our resumes 
  5. On our LinkedIn  
  6. In our email signatures  
  7. Casually talking to people (answering the question: what do you do?) 
  
  It's tough to come up with this 1-2 sentence on our own. We aren't good at being objective about what we bring to the table.  
  
  My recommendation: work it through with a friend or coach - it's worth the investment in yourself.
