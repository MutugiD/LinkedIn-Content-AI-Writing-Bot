As a marketer advising a company, you tell them they need: 
  
  1. Customer personas 
  2. Value props that resonate 
  3. A clear niche to win 
  4. Branding and offers that support that niche 
  
  What makes your consulting business any different? 
  
  You need to clearly be able to share: 
  
  1. Your unique value-add 
  2. Your ideal customer 
  3. The services you offer that help them 
  
  And then you're in an amazing position to win.
