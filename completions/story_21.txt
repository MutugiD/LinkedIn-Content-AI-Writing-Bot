Launching a successful product can be daunting, but with careful planning, utilizing resources, and plenty of hustle, amazing success can be achieved, as Uber Eats in Miami demonstrated. Prior to the launch day, Uber Eats spent six weeks of hectic preparation, focusing on a small geography and converting existing Uber riders to eaters. Couriers were also recruited from sources such as Craigslist and autoshops. They also tested the product internally and externally to get as much feedback as possible to refine the experience. Finally, they spent time pounding the pavement to get as many quality restaurants on board as possible. All these steps and resources paid off in droves with 1,003 orders on the first day.  These lessons can prove helpful when launching new products in today's competitive market.
