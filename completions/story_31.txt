It's essential for professionals to have a concrete niche that will enable them to close high-paying projects they'd enjoy working on. Refining a niche into a single, powerful statement can be tricky - but it is possible! For example, my niche was launching Uber Eats in Miami and Milan, and the client wanted to launch a food delivery marketplace. The same can be true for professionals in any field - by understanding their superpower, they can capture their ideal client's attention and make an impact. With the right approach, high-paying projects and joy-filled work are possible!
