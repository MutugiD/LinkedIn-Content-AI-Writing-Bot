I used my Uber Ops experience to build a 6-figure consulting business in 2019. 
  
  Here are the first two things I did to be successful: 
  
  
  First, I crafted a niche for myself. Telling companies I was an expert  in Operations  was useless. I learned I needed to be incredibly specific and tangible in my offer. I ended up with a few niches leaning on both my Uber Eats and Uber Freight experience. For Freight, I told companies: 
  
  I specialize in helping scale your logistics company through automation and process, given my experience launching and leading the automation team at Uber Freight to a $1B valuation in 2 years. 
  
  Immediately this sentence does two things: 
  
  1. It validates me and my experience 
  2. It shows what kind of value I can add to your company 
  
  Logistics founders and leaders would immediately perk up and be interested in learn more. 
  
  Second, I put myself out there. I networked. I was curious about others' businesses. I responded to inbounds. I jumped on calls I wouldn't normally. 
  
  And then, and this is crucial, when I saw an opportunity for me to help a company, I went for it. I suggested helping them in a  formal arrangement  where we could achieve the outcomes they were striving for together. 
  
  I told them we could start small and build from there, and I got my foot in the door. I promised accurately and overdelivered, especially early on, which got me more business. 
  
  My consulting business felt too good to be true: 2x more than my W2 salary in half the hours? It wasn't, and I continue to see colleagues doing the same!
