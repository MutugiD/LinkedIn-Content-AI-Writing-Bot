2.5 years ago I left a great job at Uber. I get asked all the time,  why did you leave? 
  
  I left because I was ready to work for myself. I knew I could add value to someone else. I had proved that to myself already. It was time to see if I could do it for myself. 
  
  I didn't know what I wanted to do. I took some time off. Then I took a few shots. I found a consulting gig. I bought a small ecommerce company and played around with it. I tried to start a company with two friends which failed miserably. I found another consulting gig. 
  
  I found my way on my own. It took a lot of belief in me. It took some failures (let's call them learnings) and some stumbles.  
  
  But now I'm here, running my own business, helping people find flexible, fulfilling work. I'm working for myself, on my own terms, doing something I love. Yes it's still hard work, but at least if I'm going to work hard, it's going to be for me.
