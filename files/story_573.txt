**Webinar Alert!** 
  
  After 4.5 years at Uber, I started helping start-ups on a contract basis and part-time, making more than my Uber salary in half the number of hours. Since then, I've helped dozens of others launch their freelance businesses, set their rates, scope out projects, and close clients. 
  
  I'm hosting a free live webinar Wednesday at 5pm PST, where I'll go through how I launched my freelance business, and how you can too!
