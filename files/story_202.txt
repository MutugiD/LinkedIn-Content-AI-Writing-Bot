When I founded Mylance, I sold our first customers with zero product.  
  
  Here’s what I did: 
  
  As I did more customer interviews, I kept hearing the same thing: my friends and colleagues wanted to consult. They wanted to work for themselves, with flexibility, part-time, and make good money. 
  
  And I knew how to do that. I had been doing it for two years! 
  
  So after the 7th time I heard this, I told that colleague I could partner with her directly to help her launch her consulting business for a fee. 
  
  She was immediately in.  
  
  I didn’t talk about the product, features, or anything about the “how.” Why not? Because I had zero idea. I hadn’t thought about this at all. I just knew I could help her. 
  
  As I had more calls, I got more interest. It was time to figure out how to deliver this for them! 
  
  So I used what was easily at my disposal. I used Google Sheets for the content, Slack for communication, Google Cal for scheduling, and Zoom for our meetings. I also used Google Forms to get feedback. Every single one of those products was free! Ok, I think I paid for Zoom premium to get 60 min meetings. 
  
  And all of a sudden I had started a business. I had customers. I had revenue. And I built zero product. And by my second cohort, my NPS scores were through the roof.  
  
  Why did this work? It was about the outcome that I delivered for these customers, not a fancy product, beautiful design, or robust features.  
  
  Looking back, it was an incredible lesson on how to start a business. Sell it first. Find customers willing to pay. Get them to pay. And then build it later.
