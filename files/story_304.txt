Opening up this exciting workshop to my LinkedIn network. 
  
  The very talented Kristen Esquivias, PCC, CPCC is hosting a 2021 in Review and 2022 Goal Setting workshop for your personal and professional life this week. 
  
  Mylance VERY lucky to have her facilitate for us - she leads workshops at Fortune 100 companies for executives, and sheâ€™s blessing us with her work on Thursday Dec 9 at 12pm PT. 
  
  I am incredibly excited myself to attend as a customer myself as I think about 2022 goal setting for both myself and Mylance! 
  
  Link to enroll is in the first comment!
