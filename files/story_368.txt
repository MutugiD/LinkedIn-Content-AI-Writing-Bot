You probably didn't think about getting me a present today for my birthday. But now that I have your attention, I'd like for you to take a few minutes today and consider to what extent you genuinely enjoy the work you're doing.  
  
  I get fulfillment out of helping others pursue their dreams and enjoy this work! 
  
  We spend so much time working. Do you enjoy it? Some days more than others? What aspects of your work do you enjoy? What parts of your work could you change to improve your happiness?  
  
  Do you wish you could work for yourself? Why don't you give it a shot? 
  
  Sometimes this time to reflect is the best present we can give ourselves.  
  
  Comment below with one thing you enjoy about your work or one thing that could improve it!
