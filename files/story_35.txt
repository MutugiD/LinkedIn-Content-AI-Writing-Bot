Six years ago today I walked into the Uber office for the first time, and was immediately confronted by my new boss trying to figure out SQL to correctly pay the drivers. 
  
  I had left a great job in consulting to take a leap into this start-up. Yes, it was a start-up. I was onboarding drivers manually. We were handing out phones. I went down to UNC during orientation with my pitch, and why riders should sign up. Most didn’t want to give their credit card info to “some app.” 
  
  While consulting, I got one piece of advice that made joining Uber easier. A 5 year vet at the firm told me,  Bradley - you can get very comfortable here. Don’t. If you get an opportunity, take it. You can always come back if it doesn’t work out. 
  
  Taking that leap to Uber changed my life. I went from managing North Carolina markets, to launching UberEATS in Miami and Milan, to launching Uber Freight in the US, to independent consulting for start-ups, and now starting my own business. 
  
  Those opportunities at Uber taught me so much both personally and professionally, and gave me the confidence to take harder and bigger leaps. 
  
  You will get a piece of advice in your career that will change the course of it. Don’t be afraid to take the leap, whatever that leap is for you.  
  
  What’s the worst that happens?
