Getting started in the consulting business is not a simple task. You won't get far by taking easy tasks such as designing a logo or creating a website. What is important is to decide your niche, reach out to your network, and reach out to as many businesses as possible in your niche every month to have meaningful conversations. These steps will ultimately lead to your first client.
