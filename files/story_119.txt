The truth is, I had no idea of my full value in the workplace until I quit. 
  
  Until then, I had managers telling me what I was  worth.  Whether I was ready for a promotion or a raise or not.  
  
  I was given a salary, a bonus, a performance review, a stock option grant.  
  
  I could question it, but that would never lead anywhere. 
  
  Once I quit to go out on my own, the tables turned. Now I was dictating the terms. I chose what I worked on. When I worked on it. Whom I partnered with. Everything was on my own terms. 
  
  With this comes an incredible sense of autonomy and authority. It also comes with a lot of fear and uncertainty. It's certainly not the path for everyone. 
  
  But for me, it immediately worked out and paid off. I found consulting clients who would pay me well more than my W2 salary in much fewer hours. I was the expert in the room. I increased my comp when I increased my value. 
  
  I've never regretted it for a second. And I'm never going back.
