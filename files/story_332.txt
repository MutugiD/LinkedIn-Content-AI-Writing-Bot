Requesting help!! 
  
  We're making users login with LinkedIn to avoid them having to duplicate information that's already there, and so their LinkedIn profile can supplement their Mylance information.  
  
  The LinkedIn API returns only name and email, and we really need their actual LinkedIn URL. To get that, we need to get approved for  r_basicprofile  API access from LinkedIn. 
  
  Does anyone have any tips for this or a contact at LinkedIn that might be able to help? Thanks in advance!
