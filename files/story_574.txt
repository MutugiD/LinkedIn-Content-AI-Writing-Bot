**FREE Webinar Alert!** 
  
  After 4.5 years at Uber in Operations, I helped start-ups on a contract basis and part-time, making more than my Uber salary in half the number of hours. Since then, I've helped dozens of others launch their freelance businesses, set their rates, scope out projects, and close clients. 
  
  I started Mylance to help others take advantage of this way of working. We help experienced tech professionals navigate the black box that is independent consulting:  
  
  How do I present my skills and hone my niche? 
  How much should I charge? 
  Do I need an LLC? 
  How do I get equity in my clients? 
  Where do I draw the line between  helping for free  and setting up a formal arrangement? 
  What about a contract? 
  
  We're going to go over all of this and more in our next Free Live Webinar! Join us Wednesday January 6th at 3pm PT. RSVP here: https://lnkd.in/gnbNRgb and comment  I'm in!  if you're planning to join.
