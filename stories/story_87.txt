On a call, there's one thing I do that has helped me win clients more than anything else. 
  
  It's not complicated, and anyone can do it.  
  
  It's asking thoughtful, curious questions. 
  
  Asking great questions does a few things: 
  
  1. If you can ask thoughtful questions in an area of your expertise, you showcase your experience indirectly. Ask how they are thinking about XYZ (your area of expertise). Keep asking until you get to a point where they don’t have a great answer. They might turn it around on you and ask for your help! Boom, you have a client. 
  
  2. It shows you’ve done your homework, and they like that you’re interested in them. 
  
  3. It gets them talking. People like talking, and especially about themselves and their business. 
  
  4. You’ll learn a lot about their business and specifically areas they need help (hint: this is key!).  
  
  Examples of good questions: 
  
  1. What in your business is keeping you up at night? 
  2. What is your two biggest business goals right now?  
  3. What's holding you back from accomplishing those goals?  
  4. What are 2 things that could happen right now that would make a step change difference for your business? 
  5. How do you think about scaling your business without adding tons of headcount? 
  
  When they answer, take detailed notes. You'll use these responses in your proposal. 
  
  I've won clients simply by being curious, and then sharing my perspective or how I solved similar problems in my past!
