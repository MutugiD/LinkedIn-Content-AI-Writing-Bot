Today's Mylance Bootcamp session was a crash course in negotiation, including live role-play simulations with each customer. It's not an easy exercise for our customers, but one they find immensely valuable given it's one of the most challenging and intimidating aspects of closing a great consulting gig. 
  
  Some key takeaways: 
  
  1. Make it easy on your client to say yes. Clearly scope out deliverables and a monthly fee they can understand and accept 
  
  2. Come prepared with your offer, knowing where you're going to anchor, where your floor is, and other things you can use to your advantage to get them across the finish line (e.g., length of term) 
  
  3. Negotiate from a position of confidence and strength. Your accomplishments are impressive and you bring immense value. Having that come across in your language and tone means everything 
  
  4. Don't negotiate against yourself, ever. If you make an offer and they push-back, make them counter 
  
  5. Never work for free. Your experience is valuable. Don't ever sell yourself short 
  
  6. I recommend going first. Dictate the negotiation, and set the anchor 
  
  7. Seek to understand your client and build a rapport with them. Use tactical empathy to your advantage - you're more likely to get what you want
