I set goals. I want to win. I want to feel good. 
  
  The challenge is, I can't  will  a win. I can't  will  my team to hit a goal. 
  
  Hitting my goals is about something else entirely. 
  
  It's about the process. Of what we do day in and day out to get that win.  
  
  It's about investments we make along the way. In my start-up, it's about investing in hiring the right people. Investing in creating processes that are effective, repeatable, and scalable. 
  
  It might require to forgo some revenue or a  quick win  now for the longer term benefit of the company. 
  
  And when those decisions are made, it's tough. I feel like I'm taking a step backwards. It's hard.  
  
  But it's required. And when you eventually come out the other side, it feels amazing. It looks to everyone else it was an overnight success. When it was anything but: you put in the time, you focused on the process, you made the investments. 
  
  And if you make the right investments and put in the hard work, then you reap the benefits. And it won't matter what anyone else says or thinks.
