It has become more challenging to get a consulting gig over the past few years - with fewer companies hiring and more experts vying for the same positions. Despite this, thousands of consultants are succeeding and even turning down work due to their high demand. To stand out, consultants need to create a niche and value-add, build a strong network, maintain connections, and provide outstanding client work. It may seem difficult, but with dedication, it is possible to make it as a consultant.
