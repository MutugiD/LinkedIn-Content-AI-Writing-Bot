The difference in mindset when it comes to setting your rates as a consultant is the difference between getting a project for $110 / hr and winning a $21,550 / month retainer.  
  
  The former thinks about the value of their time.  Well, if someone asked me for an hour of my time, how much would I charge?   
  
  While that's certainly one way to think about it, that doesn't value your experience or value-add. That's just your time. 
  
  Let's think about what happens when a company hires us for a task. What are they looking for us to accomplish? They're looking for a big change in their business. They want you to accomplish a goal, grow revenues, cut costs, improve processes, sign a new client, build a new app, etc.  
  
  The value you bring to a company isn't just your time, it's your skillset, expertise, and experience that changes their business.  
  
  To obtain that experience, you've gone to school, you've taken trainings and workshops, and you've worked at companies for however many years, hustling, grinding it out, receiving feedback, growing, learning, etc.  
  
  You've worked hard to get that experience, and THAT is what they're  buying  from you. 
  
  Make sure you're thinking about the impact to the company when you're pricing your projects, which will also give you the confidence to ask for way more than you otherwise would've. 
  
  It's not about your time. It's about your impact.
