If you're early and mid-career managers in Ops roles (e.g. in finance, biz ops, customer support, HR, sales/marketing ops) and want to make the transition into becoming an Ops Leader, I want to put something on your radar.  
  
  It's called Operate Co. It's a 7-week training program + community of startup operators looking to help each other level up their careers.  
  
  If you could see yourself as a VP- or C-level ops leader one day, this would be a good place to meet others and can help propel you there. 
  
  The goal is give you a set of mental models, frameworks, and software training that will help you succeed in any ops role. Here are the topic areas covered: 
  
  Week 1 - Problem solving  
  Week 2 - Project Management 
  Week 3 - Systems & Processes 
  Week 4 - Strategic Planning 
  Week 5 - Org Performance 
  Week 6 - Financial Performance 
  Week 7 - Org Behavior & Culture 
  
  For the community piece, they're also convening great ops talent from top startups to connect for tactical help, workshops, and mentorships. 
  
  If your company gives you an education stipend, this could be a good way to put it to use! 
  
  Here's their site: https://www.operateco.com/, or you can contact the organizer, Fadi Hindi (he's super friendly).
