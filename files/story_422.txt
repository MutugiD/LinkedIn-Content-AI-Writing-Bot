We have a few slots left in our Independent Consulting September Bootcamp kicking off Sept 14th. 
  
  Here's why you should consider growing your freelance business: 
  
  1. You get to know the company, their leadership, their product, and how you might fit in before you join full-time 
  
  2. Consulting can be a way of life - you make your own hours, work on fulfilling projects, and there's great money to be had: often more than your full-time salary 
  
  3. You scope out the type of work you enjoy 
  
  4. You can use your experience across a number of companies instead of just one 
  
  5. (and my favorite) You earn your true market rate - no more waiting for that promotion or annual 3% raise. The more value you add, the more you can charge, plain and simple
