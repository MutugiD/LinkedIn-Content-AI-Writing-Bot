I've made over $40k doing one hour expert network calls (GLG, Third Bridge, Coleman, Ridgetop Research, Guidepoint, etc.) Here are some tips to maximize your earnings: 
  
  1. Raise your rate. I started out at $250/hr and am now at $1,000/hr. They will tell you you'll get fewer calls, and maybe you will, but I doubt I got 1/4th the number of calls, so I end up ahead. 
  
  2. Do not let them pro-rate the time. You blocked off an hour for this call, get paid for it.  
  
  3. Do not apply for projects that are not in your area of expertise. You won't get it, and it wastes your time. 
  
  4. When you do get one in your area of expertise, answer it quickly. Have a standard response for all of them in that area of expertise to save time. 
  
  5. If they ask you to do a group call with a bunch of clients, ask how many clients there are, and get paid per client that joins. You're not incentivized to share in a group setting when you could get paid way more by doing individual calls.  
  
  6. Do not answer questions you don't feel comfortable. They will say they don't want confidential info and then they'll ask anyways. Keep the boundary and decline to answer.
