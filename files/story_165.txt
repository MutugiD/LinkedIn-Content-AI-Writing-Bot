Maybe I'm crazy, but I don’t ever want to retire. 
  
  While I might not work 60 hour weeks when I’m 60, I’m still going to be working. 
  
  I love working. 
  
  I love leading teams. I love helping people. I love building. I also love having income come in while I do these things. 
  
  Instead of focusing on when I can retire, I’m focused on building a sustainable and enjoyable life now.  
  
  I don’t want to be waiting for some time in the future where maybe I can or cannot afford my life without working.  
  
  I want to enjoy my life the entire way, adding value to people and companies, and doing it all while bringing in enough cash to support me and my family.
