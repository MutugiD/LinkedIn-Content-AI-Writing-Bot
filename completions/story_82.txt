In this proposal, I will start with a reminder to the client of who I am and what I’ve done in order to show why I am the best person for the project. This is a great way to stand out since many don’t to this and will remind the client of why I am the one they should hire. My proposal will provide the client with the $20k project that I recently acquired.
