Running my own business stretches me in a million ways.  
  
  Here’s how I structure my life to own my time and get some back: 
  
  1. I block off my entire mornings for myself. I know I’m my most efficient self before 1pm. So I block off that time for deep work, and take nearly all my meetings in the afternoon. 
  
  2. If I didn’t sleep well or am feeling overwhelmed, I can take the morning off. I go to the gym, go for a walk, go to my favorite coffee shop, play tennis, or just sleep in. Sometimes I need to recharge, even on a weekday, and by blocking off my morning from meetings, I can do this. 
  
  3. I use Turkey Blocker to work for 30-45 min blocks with no distractions. It blocks certain apps and websites so I can stay heads down. I’m so quick to check Twitter, LinkedIn, or email. This forces my discipline. 
  
  4. I write a to-do list the night before. I write 3-4 crucial things that need to happen to make the day a success. Those are the first things I tackle in the morning. If nothing else happens in the day, it’s already a success. 
  
  5. Every Sunday night I write the “big rocks” for the week. These roll up to our monthly OKRs, and keep me clear and focused going into the week. 
  
  6. I have a VA that helps me with my calendar, email, and small tasks. She’s online during my entire business day so when I need something, she’s there. She costs about $1k / month, and easily saves me 20-30 hours per week. 
  
  7. I’ve started saying “no” a lot more. I wish I could help everyone. But, I can’t. I take 2-3 networking calls a week now. For anything over that limit, I offer to help via a Loom video or voice note. It’s not perfect, but I know I need to prioritize my own business before I help others.
