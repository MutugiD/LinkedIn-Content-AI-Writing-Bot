To the 100k tech employees laid off this year:  
  
  being laid off is not a comment about your skills or value-add.  
  
  It's a comment on the company's ability to forecast and hire accordingly. 
  
  In fact, this is a great time to review and celebrate the experience and skills you’ve developed over your career.  
  
  Think about the countless hours you've put in, the amazing coworkers you've learned from, the courses you took, the coaching you invested in, and the outcomes that you've driven. 
  
  What you’re capable of is incredibly valuable to thousands of companies and individuals who are willing to pay great money for your expertise. Don't forget that.
