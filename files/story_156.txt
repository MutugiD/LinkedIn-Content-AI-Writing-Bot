One big mistake you might be making with your LinkedIn profile: 
  
  Advertising what the company does under their role. 
  
  The company has a marketing budget. 
  
  Your LinkedIn is yours. Write about YOUR role at the company and YOUR accomplishments in that role. 
  
  The company can use their own materials for marketing. Use your LinkedIn to help YOU stand out.
