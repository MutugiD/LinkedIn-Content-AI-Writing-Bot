These days I find it hard to stay focused. It's one thing after another that makes it feel like our world is crumbling before our eyes. 
  
  This has an unmeasurable emotional toll on everyone and it's hard to stay focused on pretty much anything.  
  
  For me, this makes time where I can focus that much more important. I need to stay productive and keep moving forward. Below I'm sharing 4 tricks I use to keep my work-life efficient:  
  
  1. Use Calendly to schedule meetings, don’t go back and forth via email 
  2. Block off dates and times for no-meetings. I usually block off before 12pm and then Tuesdays and Thursdays for no meetings 
  3. Don’t check email throughout the day. Check it 2-3 times per day at specific times and don’t check it otherwise (this one is so hard, but makes a huge difference) 
  4. aText is a “Text expander” for messages you commonly send. E.g., I have one that goes “I have my availability in Calendly here, or you can let me know some times that work and I’ll send over an invite.” This takes 2 seconds to  write  with aText, and people book time without another message.
