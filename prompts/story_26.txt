I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

To find my first consulting client, I simply asked. The company had reached out to dozens of ex-Uber folks asking for help with their food delivery marketplace, and when they reached out to me for a full-time role, I told them I wasn't open to full-time, but that I could help them part-time and still get the job done.  
  
  It was the truth - I wasn't ready to jump into another full-time role after Uber. And I wanted to help another company given my Uber Operations and launch experience.  
  
  I ended up working with that client for almost 9 months, working 25 hours per week, and kicking off my independent consulting life where I earned more than my Uber salary in half the number of hours across nearly two years. 
  
  That life is real. I'm not a designer. I'm not an engineer. I'm an operator.  
  
  Not sure if you can consult independently? You likely can, and I love helping people launch their businesses. Want some help? Comment below!

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story.
