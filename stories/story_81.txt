Relying on one company for your income is a huge mistake. 
  
  This applies to a W2 job that's your single source of income or a platform like Upwork that supplies your gigs.  
  
  Upwork can be great in some ways: it matches talent with needs and many freelancers can make solid money from it. 
  
  But they also act as a ruthless dictator in many ways.  
  
  If they decide that you have violated their terms, they don't hesitate to kick you off without warning or even hearing your side of what happened. Often, you don't even know what you did wrong! 
  
  This not only happened to me, but also the writer we've been working with at Mylance.  
  
  He spent years building up a sterling reputation on the platform only for it to be stripped away in the blink of an eye. 
  
  It's time for you as an individual to take ownership of your work. To learn how to find clients and close them without a platform. To build up multiple sources of income so if a company over hires and has to lay you off, you can have a soft landing. 
  
  It's time to take the power back, and own your work. It's the ultimate freedom.
