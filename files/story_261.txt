According to our rates database, Mylance consultants are making $550 / hr or more. But some are make only $50-$75 / hr. What's causing this huge range? 
  
  Consulting rates are all over the map. Which can be challenging and confusing.  
  
  But it's also amazing.  
  
  Consulting doesn't have the  box  that salaries do. Salaries have clear bands, levels, expected rate increases, etc.  
  
  Thereâ€™s nothing like that for consulting (yet). So you, or anyone else, can go out there with a concise and tangible niche, and go get great rates if you add enough value to a client. To do this, you'll need: 
  
  1. A super clean, concise, packaged niche 
  2. Identify your ideal client for your niche 
  3. Confidently communicate you're the best person to solve their problem 
  4. Send over a kick-ass proposal with a high rate 
  5. Negotiate like a pro
