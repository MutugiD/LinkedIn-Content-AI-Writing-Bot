Instead of raising a pre-seed round with the associated equity giving away, I found a consulting client that brought in $8.5k per month while only working five to ten hours a week. This enabled me to devote 90% of my time to my start-up, Mylance, without having to part with any equity. Over the course of the first year, I was able to gain traction, and from there was capable of raising a small round with a higher valuation. Consulting turned out to be to be an overall game changer and if other founders are looking to avoid the pre-seed round they might want to consider this strategy to acquire an extra source of income while still being able to pursue their passion project.
