When it comes to closing clients, it's important to find a balance between selling your experience and skillset and holding back valuable information that should be paid for. My advice is to listen closely, ask a lot of smart questions to validate that you know what you're talking about, and provide tidbits of your experience. Afterwards, follow up with a summary of the challenges your client is facing and how your experience can solve them. With this approach, you can close clients without giving away too much for free!
