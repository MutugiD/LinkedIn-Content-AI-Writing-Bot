The honest truth about finding your FIRST consulting client. 
  
  There's low hanging fruit where most people's first consulting client falls in their lap: 
  
  It's from their network. 
  
  The best and easiest way to find easy to convert your first client is from people that already know and trust you. 
  
  They've worked with you. They know what you're capable of and they know you're fun to work with. 
  
  Reach out to a few folks in your network and set up a catch-up call. 
  
  Note: this is not a sales call. 
  
  This is a catch-up call to see what's going on in their lives and to ask about their company and their challenges.  
  
  Maybe there's naturally an opportunity for you to help. Maybe there's not, and they refer you to a friend who might have a need. This is just opening the door to see if anything is there. 
  
  The worst case scenario is you have a nice catch-up with a colleague.  
  
  The best is you land your first client.
