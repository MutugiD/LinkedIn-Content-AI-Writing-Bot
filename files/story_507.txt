I've done more than 50 expert network calls at $1,000 / hr across GLG, Third Bridge, Coleman, Ridgetop Research, and Guidepoint, 
  
  Here's how I got that rate, and how you can maximize your earnings: 
  
  First, I established myself as an expert. I made profiles on each of the platforms and was very clear about my expertise at Uber in ridesharing, food delivery, and digital freight.  
  
  When they'd ask me to answer questions, I was very tactical in my responses about what I could talk about. No fluff here.  
  
  Then, I raised my rate. I told them I needed it to be $1,000 / hr and not pro-rated: if I was blocking off an hour, I was getting paid for it. 
  
  Here are my tips for you:  
  
  1. Raise your rate. I started out at $250/hr and am now at $1,000/hr. They will tell you you'll get fewer calls, and maybe you will, but I doubt I got 1/4th the number of calls, so I end up ahead. 
  
  2. Do not let them pro-rate the time. You blocked off an hour for this call, get paid for it.  
  
  3. Do not apply for projects that are not in your area of expertise. You won't get it, and it wastes your time. 
  
  4. When you do get one in your area of expertise, answer it quickly. Have a standard response for all of them in that area of expertise to save time. 
  
  5. If they ask you to do a group call with a bunch of clients, ask how many clients there are, and get paid per client that joins. You're not incentivized to share in a group setting when you could get paid way more by doing individual calls.  
  
  6. Do not answer questions you don't feel comfortable. They will say they don't want confidential info and then they'll ask anyways. Keep the boundary and decline to answer.
