Asking thoughtful and engaged questions is paramount in winning over potential clients. Doing so showcases your knowledge of the subject, your interest in the client and your ability to listen and understand their goals. Examples of good questions include asking what up can keep them awake at night, what their two biggest business goals are, what could make a step change difference for their business, and how do they think of scaling their business. Taking notes of the answers is also key as it will help you tailor your presentation. Even better, if you can provide examples of how you solved similar problems, you can be sure that youâ€™ll be one step ahead ahead of the competition.
