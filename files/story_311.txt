Being a founder building a company from scratch is incredibly hard. Here's what you need to make it work: 
  
  -Employees / contractors / advisors that bet on you and help you build  
  -Early adopters to take a chance on your product before you have a credible brand 
  -Investors who bet on you BEFORE you've shown huge traction 
  -Supportive family and friends, especially when times inevitably are tough 
  -A lot of mental and emotional strength to power through rejection, tough times, and disappointments 
  -Likely an incredible coach / therapist 
  
  I know I wouldn't be where I am today with all of the above, and I'm incredibly thankful for having amazing people to support me and our team at Mylance in this journey. 
  
  It's my mission to not only build a company that adds tremendous value to our users, but also to reward our employees and early investors who bet on me in these early days, BEFORE we've made it  big. 
  
  Thank you for betting on me. I'm forever grateful. And it will be 1000% worth it. 
  
  Happy Thanksgiving!
