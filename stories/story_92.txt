The best learning from my consulting business and now growing Mylance:  
  
  There's no  right  way. Everyone is winging it. Don't feel like you need to have it all figured out.  
  
  Push the ball forward every day.  
  
  Put yourself out there. Make mistakes. Learn. Keep  doing. 
  
  Good things happen when you just keep going.
