PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

Over dozens of calls with potential clients, I finally got to a good place with my niche. 
  
  Since then, I've helped hundreds of fractional execs improve their value prop. Here's our 3 step process: 
  
  We're covering the full process in the Mylance Community for the #Maymonthlychallenge but here is the TL;DR 
  
  
  -Step 1: Narrow in on what you've done in your career that's great. 
  
  Look back at your career to date and write down your professional accomplishments where you’re most proud (ideally, when you made the biggest impact to your company). 
  
  Don’t forget to think about what work you enjoyed the most. We include “enjoyed the most” so that you’re pitching yourself in a way that will lead to you working on projects that you actually want to work on. That’s one of the biggest benefits of consulting: you choose the projects YOU want to work on! 
  
  
  -Step 2: Identify your tangible, concrete skills and superpowers 
  
  Now that you have your accomplishments outlined, think through what it is about you that helped you accomplish these great things. These are the things that make you unique and different. 
  
  Write down one sentence for each accomplishment. To make this easy, you can write down them in the format of: 
  
  I'm an expert at {action you did} for {this type of company} to accomplish {what results you drove}.  
  
  
  -Step 3: Combine the two to nail your niche 
  
  Your pitch essentially aligns your area of expertise (step 2) and is backed up by your accomplishments (step 1).  
  
  So, it can look like this: 
  
  I’m an expert at launching marketplaces, including B2C, B2B, and two and three-sided marketplaces that enables me to help companies scale their operations. As Head Launcher for Miami FL, I hired a team, and designed and executed a grassroots-marketing plan including the creation of a courier and restaurant base to launch the market and hit 1,000 orders in our first day.

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story.
