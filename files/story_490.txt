In the Freight space, Uber Freight is often seen as the  gold star  regarding digital brokerages and use of tech.  
  
  Here's what really went on in the first two years of growing the company: 
  
  1. We did most things manually. We didn't have much tech at the beginning, so we onboarded customers, changed prices, and moved loads manually, just like any other brokerage. 
  
  2. We pitched shippers on a vision. We didn't have any shipper tools yet. So we pitched them on what we were building, and offered them to be an early adopter. It worked. 
  
  3. We struggled with many aspects of a business that a normal start-up struggles with, such as tracking down our AR. We often were floating well into the 6-figures of cash that our customers owed us, and struggled to collect on it. 
  
  4. Hiring was really tough. Freight isn't a sexy industry, and we needed talented tech folks to build a disrupting company. We couldn't take folks from Uber's core business, so we had to hire externally, competing with all the other fancy tech companies. 
  
  5. Our data was a mess. We so badly wanted to see in-depth metrics like our funnel conversion. But getting clean data in a presentable manner was very difficult, incredibly time consuming, and frustrating for leaders across the company. 
  
  Uber Freight is now valued at over $4B just 5 years after launching.  
  
  But it started like any other start-up: gritty, challenging, with setbacks, and pretty damn manual.
