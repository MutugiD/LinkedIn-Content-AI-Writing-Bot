There's never been a better time to find your first consulting client to diversify and supplement your income. 
  
  What are you waiting for? 
  
  What holds most back: 
  
  I don't know how to present my experience in a niche 
  
  I don't know what to charge or how to scope out a project 
  
  Can I really consult in my area of expertise? 
  
  Do I need an LLC? 
  
  Where do I find my first client? 
  
  These are all valid questions, but have easy answers. They're excuses. The only thing holding you back is YOU.  
  
  Make an agreement with yourself right now: you're going to kick off 2022 with your own consulting business!
