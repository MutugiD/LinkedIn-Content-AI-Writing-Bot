Collaborating with thousands of consultants, we've learned the best practices, and a lot of what not to do. Here are 8 of the most common mistakes freelancers make: 
  
  1. Working for free. Your experience is valuable - don't sell yourself short. 
  
  2. Lack of alignment on scope. The more detailed you can get with what you'll deliver, the more you're set up for success. 
  
  3. Selling yourself to a client. Nobody likes to be sold to. Validate yourself by asking great questions in your area of expertise. 
  
  4. Market yourself as a  jack of all trades.  Doing this makes it impossible to differentiate yourself. Set a niche and stand out. 
  
  5. Mingling personal and business finances. It's crucial to keep your revenue and expenses separate for tax purposes. 
  
  6. Charge hourly. Your incentives are misaligned with your clients. Monthly retainers align incentives and provide clarity to both sides on the financial outlay. 
  
  7. Lack of personal structure. Working for yourself, as empowering as it is, comes with its challenges. Set meetings with yourself, plan out your day the night before, and come up with a structure that works for you. 
  
  8. Lack of an agreement. Always sign an agreement. Yes, for legal protection, but also to make sure expectations are set.
