  You start talking to a company. You agree to help them out part-time because your experience aligns with what they need. Sounds great! But, then what? 
  
  How do you decide what to charge? 
  What kind of proposal do you send them? 
  Where do you get a contract template? 
  Do you set up an LLC? If so, in what state? How do you do it? 
  What does this mean for your taxes? 
  
  I faced every single one of these questions, in addition to dozens of others. As I've gotten answers, I've shared these answers with my friends and colleagues. And now, Mylance is getting you answers to those questions.
