Finding your next consulting client can be really challenging. But if you play your cards right, they come right to you! 
  
  Here's how: 
  
  1. Optimize your LinkedIn profile 
  2. Grow your network 
  3. Publish content that showcases your experience and expertise 
  
  You don't even need to say you're open to consulting. Legitimizing yourself by sharing stories from your experience does the job itself.
