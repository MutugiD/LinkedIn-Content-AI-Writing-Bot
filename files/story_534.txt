I got lucky: my first consulting client paid me $250 / hr for 25 hours per week ($25k / month) because my expertise perfectly matched what they needed. 
  
  Let me explain: 
  
  I had launched Uber Eats in two cities (Miami and Milan). My first client was a Series A self-driving company that needed to launch a food delivery marketplace. 
  
  Thus, my experience was the perfect fit for them. They could skip months of trial and error by bringing me on and leveraging what I'd already done. So was $25k / month a lot to them? No. Within a few months they could launch the marketplace, see growth, and show their investors they could hit that milestone with ease. 
  
  That helped them raise tens of millions more VC money in their Series B.  
  
  Was $25k / mo a lot for me? Hell yes. It was well more than my Uber salary. I was ecstatic. And in 1/3rd the number of hours! 
  
  I share this story to demonstrate the importance of finding clients that are in your niche where they feel LUCKY to have you. Where they need you way more than you need them.  
  
  When that happens, they'll pay you an amazing rate, you'll love the work you do because you're a complete expert in it, and they'll feel like they got a steal. 
  
  Those situations are out there. You have to niche way down and put yourself out there to find those fits. Then, make sure you ask for your full value!
