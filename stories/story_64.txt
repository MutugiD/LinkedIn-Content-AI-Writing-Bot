The early days of starting a business, regardless of whether you're consulting, launching a course, or building a software product are hard. 
  
  You get zero feedback, motivation is tough some days, and keeping momentum is tough. Here's what I did in the first few days of Mylance to keep pushing: 
  
  I kept a list of my (tiny) accomplishments.  
  
  It showed me how far I'd come and it gave me a sense of accomplishment on days when I felt down.  
  
  This helped keep me motivated and want to add more (tiny) accomplishments that pushed the business forward. 
  
  What do you do to keep the motivation high on tough days for your projects?
