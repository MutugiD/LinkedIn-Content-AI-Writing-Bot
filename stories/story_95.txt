The lowest hanging fruit for your consulting business is obvious, yet very few actually do it: 
  
  
  
  calls with your network.  
  
  Most think this won't go anywhere because there aren't immediate opportunities that come to mind. 
  
  So they don't do it.  
  
  But good things often happen when you get on calls with your network.  
  
  Projects come to life.  
  
  Additional warm introductions happen.  
  
  Collaborations on shared projects. 
  
  Reach out to 10 people in your network to set up catch-up calls. 
  
  Report back when good things happen.
