Many launch a company and raise a pre-seed round where they give away 10-20% equity before they've even launched. I avoided that and funded myself another way. Here's how: 
  
  
  I found a consulting client that maximized money for time. I worked 5-10 hours per week for them and brought in $8.5k per month. 
  
  I had to end my other consulting engagements and focus only on the one that was going to deliver this specific result so I could focus 90% of my time on Mylance. 
  
  Having this cash come in paid my bills and allowed me to invest in Mylance while not giving away any equity in the company.  
  
  Over the first 12 months of running the company, I learned what worked and what didn't work in a relatively stress-free way, and then was able to raise a small round based on the traction we'd built up (at a higher valuation than I would've in the pre-seed arena). 
  
  Consulting was a game changer for me in so many ways. If you're a founder looking for supplemental income while you get your passion project or start-up off the ground, shoot me a note! I'd love to help.
