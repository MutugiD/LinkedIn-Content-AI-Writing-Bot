investors charging founders vet company completely unacceptable. outreached us angels who, shared process me, showed charge $750-$950 deep dive screening session fee. find incredibly wrong, shared ceo us angels. wrote: feel need share feelings protect founders. charging founders money “deep screening call wrong. founders raising money (not trying spend extra money) busting tails build companies, know incredibly hard. further, many companies pass (that’s nature investing) thus you’re collecting money majority companies give investment. anything, way around: pay opportunity learn company founder share time right potentially invest company profit hard work. hope ceo us angels strongly consider remove deep screening fee, stop collecting money founders. sincerely, bradley jacobs hope founder ever pays vetted investor, join pitch competition, anything similar. investors lucky get opportunity hear business get time you. keep mindset, keep building.
