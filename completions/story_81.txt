We all should learn from the harsh experiences of others when it comes to relying on one company for income. Whether you make your living from a W2 job or from freelancing platforms like Upwork, it can be risky to put all your eggs in one basket. Such was the case for me and the writer we had been working with, who was abruptly removed from Upwork without warning or explanation, despite his spotless reputation that he had built up over years. Take control of your work: broaden the search, learn to close deals without a platform, and have multiple sources of income so you can soften any unexpected layoffs. It's time to take the power back and own your work, which is ultimately the ultimate freedom.
