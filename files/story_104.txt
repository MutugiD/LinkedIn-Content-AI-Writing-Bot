Negotiating used to make me nervous.  
  
  Now, I love it. Here’s how I reframed it for myself: 
  
  The first time I negotiated for myself, I got a $250 / hr, $25k / month consulting client. But I was terrified.  
  
  I didn’t want to lose the deal, but I also wanted to get what I thought I deserved. It felt like a really difficult position. 
  
  But now, I look forward to it. 
  
  I think of negotiating as a fact-finding mission: I’m trying to learn as much as possible about the other side. I learn by asking curious questions. 
  
  I also make sure they feel heard. I repeat what I hear back to them.  
  
  Sometimes I don’t have it quite right, and they correct me. 
  
  I also label what I hear from them. “It seems like you’re tight on budget.” 
  
  Again, they will correct me. If I’m right, they will validate it, and they’ll feel heard. 
  
  By learning everything about their side, I can suggest solutions that work for both of us.  
  
  Usually, there’s overlap in what we both want, and by asking questions, I can more easily find that overlap. 
  
  Lastly, I'll go into the conversation prepared. I know my floor. I know what “good” would look like for me. I anchor high, ask questions, and never negotiate against myself. 
  
  I also know I need to be okay to walk away. I know it’s better to not make any deal than agree to one I’ll regret. 
  
  Big shout out to Christopher Voss with his book “Never Split the Difference” which helped me change my entire perspective on negotiating, and changed my life more than any other book I’ve read!
