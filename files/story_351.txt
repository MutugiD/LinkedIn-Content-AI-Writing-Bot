Going out on your own is scary. There's a fear of rejection that comes from needing to put yourself out there. I experienced it myself, and I hear it from nearly every person I talk to.  
  
  Are there clients that need my expertise? 
  
  I'm not sure I have enough experience. 
  
  Will I be able to charge enough? 
  
  How do I go about finding a client? 
  
  These questions are rooted in fear. Mylance empowers you with the confidence, tactics, and process to put yourself out there in a way we know works. It's worked for hundreds of others, and it can work for you too. Shoot me a note if you'd like to learn more!
