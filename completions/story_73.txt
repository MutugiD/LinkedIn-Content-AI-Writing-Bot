Feeling like an "imposter" due to your expertise is quite common and you should not be ashamed of it. Remember, you have unique skills that no one else does and those skills has been cultivated by all the hard work you have done. Your track record of success and newly acquired knowledge is a testament of that. Believe in yourself and own your worth, for no one else can make you do that.
