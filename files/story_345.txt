For all the flexibility consulting provides, it does come with its share of challenges. If it were easy, everyone would do it. But, it's not easy, and there are ups and downs with going out on your own.  
  
  That's why it's important to have clear intentions going in. 
  
  What are you looking to get out of your consulting business? 
  
   -Make more money?  
   -Experience working across different companies?  
   -Get a small equity portfolio?  
   -Learn a new skill? 
  
  Whatever it is for you, write it down and be clear on why you want to consult. It might be as simple as  I want to work for myself.  That's fine. Write it down. This will help you navigate difficult client situations. 
  
  For example, maybe you decide you want to consult so you can work with companies where you really align with their mission in solving a problem for a customer base you care about. In that case, when you find those clients, you might be willing to compromise on your rate a bit because it's not completely about the money. However, if you find yourself connected to a big company that doesn't fit into that bucket, you can feel comfortable asking for a lot more because that engagement would be more about paying the bills for you versus aligned with your mission.
