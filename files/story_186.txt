“Growth happens slowly and then all at once”  
  
  It’s a cliche but it’s true. And it’s true for your consulting business too.  
  
  There’s pre-work required to be successful over the long term. You need to come up with a great offer, nail down your ideal client, set your rates, and begin your lead generation process. 
  
  It’s unlikely to yield immediate results. But your efforts compound.  
  
  And if you can sustain your efforts and stay positive through the early days, even if there are little positive results, those positives results are right around the corner. 
  
  And if your goal is something like $20k / month, that’s only two clients at $10k per month each, which tons of our customers are getting. 
  
  That growth is right around the corner - you just need to stick it out and keep working hard and smart. You got this.
