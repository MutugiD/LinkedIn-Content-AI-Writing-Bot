Let's be honest: nobody outside of Uber knows what  Operations at Uber  means. It sounds fine, but nobody had any idea what I was capable of.  
  
  When talking to potential consulting clients, I learned to pitch myself as a marketplace launch expert. I'd launched UberEATS in Miami, FL and Milan, Italy, and I'd launched the Uber Freight business as well.  
  
  So,  I specialize in launching and scaling 2 and 3 sided marketplaces.  This not only sounds a hell of a lot better than  I worked in Operations at Uber,  but it also makes sense to a potential client. They get what value I'm capable of providing to their business.  
  
  As a consultant, your goal to narrow it down as much as possible. You might think of yourself as a  jack of all trades,  and maybe you are! But that's not going to help you find a client. There are likely thousands of people that have a similar set of experiences as you.  
  
  How are you going to set yourself a part? The way to do is it to get incredibly specific at what you do.  
  
  For me, I leaned hard into my food delivery and freight experience. How many people had owned the full launch of a food delivery marketplace? A few, but not a ton. What is that thing for you? For me, this is how I got my first client.
