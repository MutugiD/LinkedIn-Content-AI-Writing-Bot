Launching Uber Eats in Miami was no easy feat, however with the help of a team of five hungry and personable sales reps along with a structured approach and strategy, we recruited over 100 restaurants in just 6 weeks. We modelled what needed to happen every day, created a restaurant sales playbook, set performance bonuses and quotas, shared best practices, and offered lower starter commission rates. Through hard work and team dedication, we were able to exceed our goals and reach the launch date on time with the right partner restaurants.
