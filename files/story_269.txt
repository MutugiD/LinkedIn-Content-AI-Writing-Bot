I'm seeing a lot of messages from Duke and UNC fans alike about how  miserable  this game is going to be. I understand the sentiment, but completely disagree. 
  
  This is an opportunity. An opportunity for one of the best rivalries in all of sports to play a game on the biggest college basketball stage. It's never happened before, and may never happen again. For these kids, it's an opportunity of a lifetime. 
  
  The argument I'm hearing is  well if we lose it'll be horrible.  And they're right. It'll suck for whoever loses.  
  
  But for the team that wins, it'll be one of the defining wins in program history. And the opportunity to play on that court for that  win  is a privilege, and one I'm sure these kids are ecstatic about. 
  
  Whether you think this game is an opportunity or  miserable  is an example of how you look at life. You can go into an interview thinking it's your job to win or lose. Start a company wondering how you'll fail or what it will take to succeed.  
  
  Mindset in life is everything, and if I had to pick the one differentiator between successful business owners and not, it's mindset. It's confidence, it's optimism, and it's grit. It's whoever is willing to see the glass half-full, take the learnings and feedback in stride, and press forward. 
  
  This game on Saturday is the same thing. It's a game where you throw out the pure talent, and it's all about who wants it more, and who's going in to take advantage of an incredible opportunity sitting in front of you. 
  
  Which side of that coin are you on?
