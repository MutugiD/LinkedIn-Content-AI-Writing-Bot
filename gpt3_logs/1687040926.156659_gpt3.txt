PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.

RESPONSE:

It's a new year and as always, we can choose if we want to work in Corporate or become an expert consultant. Working in Corporate at Uber, I received a total annual comp of $180k, attended 6 hours of meetings a day and worked 65 hours a week with an hourly rate of $56, though when I decided to work on my own as a expert consultant, my total annual comp increased to $310k, with only 1 hour of meeting a day and only 30 hours of weekly work for an average hourly rate of $210 - the decision is yours and you should choose according to what you are looking for.
