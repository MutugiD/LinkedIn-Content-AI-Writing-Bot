Not every intro call will turn into a high paying contract. In fact, the majority of potential clients won't work out. 
  
  Your first call is key to determine how well your area of expertise and experience fits with the company's biggest challenges. 
  
  If it's a great fit, they'll really need you, and you'll likely be able to get a high paying gig.  
  
  If not, it's probably best for you to move on and find a better fit. Even if you do agree with that client, you won't be negotiating from a position of strength - you always want to be needed more than you need them. 
  
  At the height of my consulting, I found 3-5 intro calls per week. Maybe 1 in 5 of those would follow-up with a proposal because I was very clear, and got better over time, in finding potential clients where my experience was an excellent fit for their challenges. 
  
  Then, I had a very high, (over 50%) rate on those proposals turning into high-paying gigs. The key is to filter really well at the beginning, and then invest heavily in those relationships.
