When I closed by first client making a full 6 figure salary in 25 hours per week, I felt lucky. It felt too good to be true. It wasn't, but I did make many mistakes along the way. Here are 5 mistakes I made that I would never do again: 
  
  1. I sent over a detailed deck for my proposal, which I spent a ton of time on. While it worked, it definitely wasn't required. I now send over Google doc proposals with 4 specific sections that's often only 1-1.5 pages 
  
  2. I agreed to an hourly rate where I kept a time sheet that they approved weekly. I also had to write what I did each day in that time. Never never never again. This misaligns incentives, forced me to keep track of my time, and created uncertainty how much I'd make each month. I moved to monthly retainers with every client after that. 
  
  3. I didn't put structure in place in my life, and early on felt aimless during many of my days. I didn't carve out time for things, I didn't own my calendar, and I didn't prioritize well. The lack of structure in working 25 hours per week, while amazing, caused some anxiety and existential thoughts. 
  
  4. I didn't have my  why  nailed down which made my question my success. Making a full salary in 25 hours per week felt surreal. And without a manager, colleagues, peers, etc., I constantly questioned if I was doing  well.  Having intentionality into  why  I do something and writing down what success to me looks like has helped me avoid needing external validating, and get it from within instead.
