I talk a lot about how great it was to quit my job and grow my consulting business.  
  
  But quitting was scary. I didn't feel ready. So I did a crucial step before I quit to make it a lot easier: 
  
  I found out my worth in the market. 
  
  Let me explain. 
  
  I had worked at Uber for 4.5 years. I hadn't touched my resume in that time. I hadn't interviewed for other jobs. And I was a completely different professional leaving Uber than I was going into Uber. 
  
  And I had ZERO idea what my value was on the professional job market. 
  
  So first, I polished my resume. I hadn't done this in years, so I actually contracted a professional resume writing firm to help me. 
  
  Then, I submitted my resume into a few different jobs that looked interesting, I did some networking to discuss open roles at start-ups, and interviewed to understand my value.  
  
  Of course, if there had been a great opportunity, I was open to taking it. 
  
  But most importantly, I learned how others perceived my experience, and it gave me confidence if going out on my own didn't work, I had significant value in the market. 
  
  In my mind, it was my backup plan. One that I never hoped to pursue, but one that I had in my back pocket.  
  
  I'd never been on my own. And I'd always been taught that I should go get a job and move up the ladder. 
  
  But I didn't want that anymore. I wanted to be on my own. This process gave me tremendous peace of mind that the path I was leaving behind was still there for me if I needed it.
