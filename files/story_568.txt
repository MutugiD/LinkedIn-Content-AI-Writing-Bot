After going through the Mylance Accelerator, Jeremy found a gig at the top streaming music service, and is now the Head of SEO at Spotify! 
  
  Whether you end up consulting full-time or using it to find another job, it's an incredibly powerful skill to have, and you never know where it will take you. 
  
  For me, consulting supported an exploratory phase for me between Uber and starting my own company. 
  
  Further, once I started Mylance, I kept one consulting client that brought in $5k per month in minimal hours. It funded my life so I could focus on my start-up! 
  
  Is there a dream you've been wanting to explore but haven't yet?
