After I launched Uber Eats in Miami, Uber asked me if I wanted to interview for the Miami GM position - a dream job for me.  
  
  I happily interviewed. But after one round of interviews, I got rejected. 
  
  The launch had gone well. Why didn't I make it to even the second round? I was surprised and upset.  
  
  I asked for feedback. As much as it hurt, I wanted to learn why I didn't get the role. I found out they wanted someone with more managerial experience.  
  
  That hurt. They had asked ME if I wanted to interview. I guess it didn't matter that I had managed multiple teams already at Uber. And it didn't matter that I had just facilitated a great launch of the city. They had their criteria, and they stuck to it. 
  
  I was frustrated. It had been my dream to be a GM at Uber. But, it wasn't going to happen at that time. 
  
  As I tried to get another GM role, I got some tough feedback: don't go in asking for a position because you want it or it's good for you. A company hires you or promotes you because it will help THEM. The pitch needs to be about them. 
  
  I hadn't gone about this the right way, and I was ready to act on the feedback.  
  
  I had one thing that very few people at the company had: Uber Eats launch experience. Thus, I found out where we were going to launch next. All of Europe. Boom. I got in touch with the recruiter, shared my launch experience, and told her I could add value to THEM. 
  
  She saw that value, and put me in touch with the GM, who told me to get on a plane and get over to Amsterdam immediately.  
  
  Rejection is hard. It sucks. Nobody likes it. But, after you digest the hurt that comes with it, it's an opportunity to learn from the experience and grow from it.  
  
  I learned a valuable lesson, and as painful as it was, I know I'm better for it.
