PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years. The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, 
making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. I will through the provided narrative in story, master 
and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will hold myself to the highest literary standards, and  my writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  


STORY:
================================

When I left Uber, I went through my LinkedIn inbound messages and responded that I wasn't open to full-time jobs, but I would be open to helping part-time as a consultant.  
  
  It was a shot in the dark. I had no idea if this was possible for someone like me. 
  
  I responded to 12 companies. 11 said  no  or didn't respond. 1 responded favorably, and asked to talk further. 
  
  That one company who did respond ended up being my first consulting client.  
  
  You're not going to shoot 100%. Or even 50%. But if you put yourself out there enough times, you're going to eventually find success. 
  
  I didn't know what was possible until I asked for it. And turns out not only was it possible, but it would change my life forever. 
  
  What do you have to lose? The bigger loss is not ever trying.

I will write a repurposed story after mastering the tone, persona and style of writing when prompted:

RESPONSE:

After I left Uber, I decided to put myself out there and see if I could find any consulting work. I went through my LinkedIn messages and told companies that I was open to helping out part-time. 
  
  It was a shot in the dark, but I figured it was worth a try. I had no idea if this was possible for someone like me. 
  
  I responded to 12 companies. 11 said no or didn't respond. 1 responded favorably and asked to talk further. 
  
  That one company who did respond ended up being my first consulting client.  
  
  It just goes to show that you never know what's possible until you ask for it. And sometimes, all it takes is one yes to change your life forever. 
  
  So don't be afraid to put yourself out there and just try. What do you have to lose?
