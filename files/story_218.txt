W2 jobs are supposed to be stable and secure.  
  
  That couldn't be further from the truth. 
  
  One source of income can be taken away from you at any moment without any warning or wrong-doing on your end.  
  
  You might have already been laid off. At a minimum you've seen friends get laid off and you've asked yourself,  could that happen to me? 
  
  The fastest and easiest additional income stream is you. You are a finished product. Polished with years of experience. 
  
  Your experience is incredibly valuable. Companies would pay a ton to learn from you and avoid mistakes that you've already conquered. 
  
  What you need to get started: 
  
  1. Intention - what does  good  look like? 
  2. A well defined niche - where is your experience a value-add to a company? 
  3. Your offer - who's your ideal client, what will you do for them, and what will you charge? 
  4. Outreach. Do some networking. Set up 10 calls. 
  
  There's nothing preventing you from getting started on this today, and you could have your first client within a week. 
  
  My first client brought in $25k / month, and changed my life forever.  
  
  What are you waiting for?
