As an entrepreneur, I understand the importance of product market fit in taking a business to the next level and know the principles inside and out. Yet, I found myself and the rest of my team losing our way at times. To ensure that happens less, I hired a coach who is an expert in behavior science, has built his own businesses, and advises dozens of others. Meeting with my coach weekly has allowed me to stay focused on the right thing to build and is definitely worth the cost. Even though I understand the principles, it's still a lot harder in practice than theory, making a coach a great asset for any professional.
