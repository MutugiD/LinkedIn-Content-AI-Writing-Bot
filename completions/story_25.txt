Launching Uber Eats in Miami was no easy feat, but with smart planning, hard work, and patience, we succeeded. We hired 5 sales reps quickly, set targets, designed and refined the pitch, and even offered lower commission rates in exchange for partnership. It was a team effort - between the sales reps competing to close deals and managers stepping in to help get those tough deals over the line. Together, we hustled and grinded and ended up with 100+ restaurants signed up in time for the launch. This experience has stayed with me and still serves as a reminder that there are no shortcuts to success - it takes passion, perseverance and hard work.
