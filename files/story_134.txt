Every week we send out a newsletter that includes tips to help grow your consulting business. Today's topic was  What to consider when switching from W2 to 1099. 
  
  Here's a small excerpt: 
  
  The first thing to consider is what you're optimizing for. As an example, are you optimizing for income, more free time, more flexibility? 
  
  Consulting has its pros and cons.  
  
  You're your own boss, you choose who you work with, you choose your projects, you set your own rates and you have all the flexibility you can imagine.  
  
  You'll also have multiple streams of income. So, if a client drops you or a project ends, you'll still have money coming in.  
  
  Remember, if you get fired or laid off from a W2 job, you'll lose your only source of income. 
  
  However, consulting can be a bit of a roller coaster at times. 
  Your consulting business often won't provide the level of stability that a W2 job generally does. You'll win clients. You'll lose clients. You'll have to market yourself consistently to get new clients. 
  
  Transitioning to consulting means you're starting your own business. Starting your own business also brings the added responsibilities of bookkeeping, taxes, finding health insurance, and working through your personal financials in a more robust way. 
  
  What it boils down to is: you're getting flexibility and freedom that can require a bit more work with less stability.
