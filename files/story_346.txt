Each professional step I've taken I've been scared. Scared of failing. Scared of what others might think. Scared of putting myself out there. I wasn't sure if I could do it, and I wondered what would happen if I failed. 
  
  The more I've spoken to friends, colleagues, and peers, this seems to be a common thread: diminishing our accomplishments or having uncertainty about taking that next step. At Mylance we call in Imposter Thoughts (not imposter syndrome!). 
  
  When going out on your own, this fear is incredibly strong and present in so many, regardless of past professional accomplishments.  
  
  If you're feeling this, know you're not alone. Think about what you've done in your career (write it down!) and look back. Did you know you'd succeed going into that new job or new role? Of course not. But you figured it out. Maybe you got knocked down, rejected, laid off or fired. And then you got back up and accomplished something else, and did it better.  
  
  Take this with you. Realize you are capable. You can do it. And the only failure would be not to try. Put yourself out there and see what happens!
