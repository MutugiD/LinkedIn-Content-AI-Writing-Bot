done quite expert network calls (glg, coleman, ridgetop, guidepoint, etc.) past years, here's i've learned: 1. get high hourly rate. don’t anything less $300, often few, go high $1,000/hr more. raise rate consistently. 2. don’t share anything can’t find publicly. they’ll say don’t want it, likely ask anyways. always feel free decline answer question 3. ask 1 hour minimum time. don’t let pro-rate session (unless goes hour). blocked hour get paid whole hour 4. don’t think topic applies you, bother filling form. it’s waste time likely hundreds people they're asking topic. otherwise, give shot see make side income! #sidehustles #researchcalls #whynot
