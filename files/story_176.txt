How do you set yourself apart from other professionals when more consultants flood the market? 
  
  Over time, there's no doubt there will be more and more consultants because so many people want to work for themselves with flexibility.  
  
  So we do need to continually set ourselves apart. The good news is that as earlier adopters, you are ahead of the game because you can confidently pitch yourself, prospect, scope out engagements, and more easily close the deal.  
  
  Closing the deal is half the battle. It’s not ALL about your expertise and experience, it’s also about how well you go from intro, to scope, to proposal, to close. 
  
  As far as your expertise, you’re continually building on that with every project you do and every client you take on. You’re learning new things, you’re growing, your experience is expanding.  
  
  Your job is to continually refine your niche and pitch to reflect this. You’re only getting more experience and thus more valuable to your clients.  
  
  You can capture that in your niche and pitch to have it be more rich over time, making you more and more attractive to clients.  
  
  Your job is to stay in the top 1% of what you do. That might mean narrowing your niche or rounding out your experiences.  
  
  For example, if I’m an Operations expert but I get some product experience at one of my clients, now my Operations experience is bolstered by that. I’m now more powerful to a client because of my Product experience. You can apply this no matter your expertise.
