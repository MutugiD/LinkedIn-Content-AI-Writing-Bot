I experienced that heart dropping feeling: a letter from the IRS that I owed $13,500. What happened, how I got out of it, and how I got a refund! 
  
  It started in late 2020 when I first got the letter. The IRS claimed they didn't receive my extension, and thus I owed penalties and interest that was over $13k.  
  
  My stomach dropped. 
  
  I reached out to my personal CPA at the time who told me to  just pay it.  I couldn't believe her answer. I immediately sought out another opinion. 
  
  Right around this time we brought on Bethany Swartwood as our Head of Accounting to Mylance. She told me everything would be okay, and got to work. 
  
  After a lot of back and forth with the IRS, she was able to use her magic to get ALL THE PENALTIES removed, AND I now have a check coming in the mail for over $200 in refunds. She coached me what to say, she called in herself on a separate  tax preparers line,  and got the job done. 
  
  The moral for me: having someone like this on your side taking care of your books / taxes is game changing. It saves you thousands of dollars, and gives you peace of mind knowing even if you get a nasty letter in the mail or a big tax bill, everything is going to be okay.
