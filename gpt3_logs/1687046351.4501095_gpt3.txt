The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

The early days of starting a business, regardless of whether you're consulting, launching a course, or building a software product are hard. 
  
  You get zero feedback, motivation is tough some days, and keeping momentum is tough. Here's what I did in the first few days of Mylance to keep pushing: 
  
  I kept a list of my (tiny) accomplishments.  
  
  It showed me how far I'd come and it gave me a sense of accomplishment on days when I felt down.  
  
  This helped keep me motivated and want to add more (tiny) accomplishments that pushed the business forward. 
  
  What do you do to keep the motivation high on tough days for your projects?

================================
END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story. 

SUMMARY: 




==========

RESPONSE:

Running a business in its early days can be extremely difficult and often unmotivating. To stay motivated, I keep a list of all my tiny accomplishments – no matter how small – to be reminded of how far I’ve come and to encourage me to keep pushing forward. What are your strategies for maintaining motivation for your projects?
