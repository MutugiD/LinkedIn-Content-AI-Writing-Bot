No matter which business owner I talk to, I consistently hear the same thing:  
  
  1. Building your own business is harder than they thought 
  
  2. Takes longer than they thought 
  
  3. Takes more grit than they thought. 
  
  Going out on my own has been the most rewarding and fulfilling path. Even on the most difficult of days, I wouldn't change a thing. 
  
  But it also comes with the most challenge I've ever faced in my life. 
  
  Anyone you see that's doing their own thing: they deserve huge props.  
  
  What they're doing takes an immense about of courage and grit that only other business owners can truly empathize with.
