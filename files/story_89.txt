When I started Mylance, I got every piece of advice you could imagine: 
  
  -  Raise money - it'll be so easy for you and then you can scale fast 
  
  -  Don't ever raise money - you'll have a boss and you'll be miserable 
  
  -  Don't raise until you have PMF. Then raise a ton and scale 
  
  All of these comments were from very successful, wise people. 
  
  The point is there's no right way to do anything.  
  
  Build your company how you want. Get advice from mentors and advisors for their thoughts, and then consider what YOU actually think is best for your situation and your company.
