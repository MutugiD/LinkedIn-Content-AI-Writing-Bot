We see it in sports all the time. Inches between a win or a loss.  
  
  Your professional life isn't any different. 
  
  You're deciding whether to take on a new project, leave a company, enroll in a program, find a coach, or start that consulting business. 
  
  The decision could really go either way. It's close. It's inches away from the other.  
  
  But that's all it takes. And in sports those inches lead to wins and losses, which compound to seasons, playoffs, and championships. 
  
  You might be on the verge of a decision, not quite sure what the best answer is. That verge is inches away from a win.  
  
  And following your gut, being honest with your self, and investing in yourself is one way to ensure those wins outpace the losses, and they compile to a playoff run and a trophy on your desk.
