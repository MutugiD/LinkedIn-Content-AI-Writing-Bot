PSA to employers: your best employees want to have part-time work on the side. They want it because they crave flexibility and freedom.  
  
  They also want to be truly valued for their contributions to the company.  
  
  Not paying fair salaries, enabling remote work, and being open-minded to part-time projects is the fastest way to lose your best people.  
  
  Don't stifle these desires. Accommodate them and facilitate them to keep your best people.
