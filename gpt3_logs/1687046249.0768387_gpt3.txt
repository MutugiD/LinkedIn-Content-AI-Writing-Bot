PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

When I left Uber and started to consult, I heard time and time again  you can't possibly freelance consult in Operations.  It just didn't compute: they had always heard that independent consulting was for designers and engineers, so that's what they took as fact. 
  
  I didn't really know what was possible, and figured I'd give it a shot. I'd see if I could find a part-time project in Operations given my experience and skillset. And my first client was a Series A company who essentially needed a Head of Operations, and they let me do the role in 25 hours per week as a contractor.  
  
  This opened up my eyes, and I looked for more clients. In this journey, I found more clients than I could handle, and ended up referring those clients to friends and having to say  no  a lot. 
  
  The people who told me consulting in Operation isn't possible had no idea. They hadn't tried it. They just went with what they'd heard.  
  
  Challenge yourself and others. Make up your own ideas. Try new things. You never know what's possible, but one thing is true: if you don't think it's possible, then that's certainly true for YOU.

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story. 

SUMMARY: 




==========

RESPONSE:

When I left Uber and started consulting, many people thought it was impossible to freelance in Operations. Not knowing the possibilities, I gave it a try and landed a part-time project in Operations with my first client, a Series A company. I ended up with more clients than I could handle and so I referred them to my friends. I learned that sometimes people assume things to be true without trying and that the only thing true for sure is that if you don't think it's possible, then it's true for you. Take the risk, try something, and don't assume: who knows the possibilities!
