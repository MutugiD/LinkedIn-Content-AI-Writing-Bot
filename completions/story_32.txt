After two years at Uber, I realized that I was missing out on potential opportunities and decided to take a leap of faith and quit my job. I then ventured into a myriad of ventures ranging from e-commerce, tech placements, blogging, consulting, and eventually starting my own software company. As I progressed, I gained valuable skills and made lifelong connections along the way. Ultimately, I was able to achieve my end goal of running my own successful business and used the money from consulting to fund my endeavors. Despite it being a scary move, I pushed through and proved to myself that I was capable of succeeding on my own.
