You start talking to a potential consulting client. You want to send over some more detail about you. Do you send your LinkedIn profile? A resume?  
  
  Neither seem to really get the job done. You want to show you're legit, detail out your past experiences, and validate yourself as a consultant. What you want is your own website.  
  
  We've identified 8 key components to a consulting website to accomplish your goals:  
  
  1. How you uniquely add value to businesses 
  2. Your past experiences (validation) 
  3. Your bio - what makes you interesting? 
  4. Sample projects or case studies 
  5. Expert opinions or content (optional) 
  6. Testimonials 
  7. Way to get in touch with you 
  8. Professional look and feel 
  
  We've detailed these out in our free guide we just published today (link in the comments) to read further.
