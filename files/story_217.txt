You know you have great experience.  
  
  You know you bring value to the table.  
  
  But, as a consultant, you don't know how much to charge. 
  
  Well let me tell you the first things NOT to do: 
  
  1. Do not ask them to name a price. They will base it on something random or another consultant and unless you're fairly confident they'll offer way more than you'd ever ask for, you have a 95% chance of letting them anchor very low. 
  
  2. Do not throw out some random number like $100 / hr. It's clearly made-up, shows no professionalism or forethought, and it under cuts your value. 
  
  3. Do not assume they won't be able to pay you your value. You can always make an offer, and then it's up to them to say  no  and counter. Don't make any assumptions. 
  
  Tune in tomorrow for 3 things you SHOULD do.
