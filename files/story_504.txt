If you just got laid off, read this: 
  
  getting laid off usually isn't fun. It can feel like rejection. 
  
  But it isn't. It's not about you. It's about the company. They made bad decisions, didn't stay nimble enough, and unfortunately you're the consequence. 
  
  But getting laid off is an opportunity. An opportunity to see the infinite options you have for how you spend the majority of your waking hours during the week. 
  
  When I left Uber, I took the opportunity to: 
  1. Take some time off (luckily saved enough to make it a few months) 
  2. Find my first $25k / month consulting client 
  3. Buy and sell an ecommerce company 
  4. Start (and promptly shut down) a blog 
  5. Build a tech company with a few friends (that went nowhere) 
  6. Make money by helping place folks in my network at companies that were hiring 
    
  I experimented. I learned. I got to explore. 
  
  Maybe you've always wanted to work for yourself. Maybe you've always wanted to take some time off. Maybe you've always wanted to take that vacation. Maybe you've always wanted to shift industries and now you have that perfect opportunity. 
  
  If income is the main concern, one of the best ways to support yourself immediately without jumping head first into another company is consulting. 
  
  You're already a finished product. And you could find 15-20 hours worth of work per week while you figure out next steps. The money is good, the work is fulfilling, and you have plenty of time back for yourself.
