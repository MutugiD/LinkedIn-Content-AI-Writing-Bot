In my last year at Uber, I was in an average of 7 meetings a day. It was basically all I did. And it drove me crazy. 
  
  Since I quit Uber in 2018 I've: 
  
  1. Completely dictated my schedule 
  2. Started work when I want  
  3. Worked from wherever I want 
  4. Dictated by own rates  
  5. Chosen my clients and projects 
  
  Being on your own isn't all glorious: I do pay for my own health insurance. 
  
  But I also made WAY more as a consultant working part-time than I ever did as a FTE. 
  
  I'd say it's been worth the trade-off for me! What about you?
