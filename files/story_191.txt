Today, I woke up with a million thoughts about my business. How we can drive more leads. How we can add more value to our customers. 
  
  I had so many ideas I wanted to get to work on. 
  
  It made me want to jump out of bed and immediately start working. 
  
  Some might think that's crazy - it's Saturday morning! 
  
  But I don't care. It's a day without meetings that I can focus on getting sh*t done in my business.  
  
  I have clarity in what we need to do, the motivation to build this company and help as many people as possible, and the passion for the problem. 
  
  Some weeks are tough. But this isn't one of those weeks. This is a week of excitement and clarity (which as an entrepreneur can be rare). So I'm taking advantage. And I don't care what anyone thinks.  
  
  There are no overnight successes. It takes hard work, grit, and determination. Sometimes that means taking days or weeks off to recharge. Sometimes it means working on Saturday morning. I'm listening to my body and mind, and following what feels best.
