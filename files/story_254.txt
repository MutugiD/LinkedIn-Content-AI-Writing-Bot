Most people don't know this but I failed to start numerous times before I got Mylance off the ground. 
  
  The biggest difference in those times: 
  
  I didn't follow through. I didn't FULLY commit to it. I didn't invest in myself. I didn't take the steps required.  
  
  I'd start. And stop. And start again. And stop again. 
  
  The easiest business to start is where you're the product. You can start this TODAY. Like right now.  
  
  You can: 
  
  1. Hone your niche and decide what you're going to consult in 
  2. Write up your ideal client 
  3. Start outreach 
  4. Invest in the coaching required to overcome any barriers holding you back 
  
  Or you can keep doing what you're doing. 
  
  In January 2020 I decided to incorporate Mylance and knew with 1000% certainty I would do whatever it took to succeed. 
  
  In my opinion, the only way to succeed is with relentless determination and grit. Because it's hard. But you can do hard things if you put your mind to it.
