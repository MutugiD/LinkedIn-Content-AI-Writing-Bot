During these uncertain times, everyone is reminding you to have a diversified portfolio because we never know what's going to happen.  
  
  Few will argue this about your financial portfolio, but it's not common in your work life. Why not? Having one employer / job is incredibly risky! 
  
  Do you have a side hustle? Share what you're working on! You might inspire some others...
