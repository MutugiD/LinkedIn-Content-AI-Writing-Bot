May 12th will always be a date that's meaningful to me. I had always wanted to work for myself, and little did I know it at the time, but May 12th 2014 was the date that was all set in motion.  
  
  May 12th, 7 years ago, I walked into the office for my first day at a new job to my hectic boss scrambling around trying to figure out how she was going to get everything done.  
  
  It was my first day at a tech company. It also turned out to be my first day learning SQL, being a customer service agent, learning supply and demand dynamics, learning how to launch a new marketplace, and what we meant by  driver incentives. 
  
  When I started, my job was far from glorious. I did whatever it took to grow the business, whether that was manually reviewing background checks or answering driver emails.  
  
  Fast forward 4 years and I was leading an Operations team at our Freight business. I had learned a ton, met incredible people, and had experiences under my belt that would set me up incredibly well to work for myself as a freelancer, and then a founder. 
  
  May 12th, 2014 was my first day at Uber.
