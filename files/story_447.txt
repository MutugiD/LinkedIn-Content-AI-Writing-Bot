While Mylance is incredibly young and small, I want to establish an inclusive culture from Day 1. I want a diverse team, I want to proactively recruit minorities to be a part of our community, and create partnerships with communities that serve minority groups. 
  
  Even though Mylance is tiny (and so are our revenues), I know that even small acts are helpful. To that end, we’re donating 10% of June’s revenue to Black Girls CODE. Not only are women severely underrepresented in tech, but even moreso are minority women. In 177 tech firms in the Bay Area, under 2% of employees are African-American, Latina, or Native American women. 
  
  Given our revenues, it won’t be a lot, but we see this donation as a first step in the right direction, and I hope that in doing so, we are further defining our high expectations for ourselves, and for what Mylance stands for as we build this company.
