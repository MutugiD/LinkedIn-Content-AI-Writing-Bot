Networking is one of the lowest hanging fruits for consulting businesses, yet far too few people actually take advantage of it consistently. By jumping on calls with your network, you open yourself up to a world of benefits, such as potential projects, warm introductions to potential colleagues and clients, and collaborations on shared projects. On top of that, it's a great way to stay in touch with those in your field. To kick-start the process, reach out to 10 people in your network to set up casual catch-up calls. You'll be negatively surprised by the positive results!
