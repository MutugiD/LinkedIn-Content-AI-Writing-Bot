I'm helping scope a product to scale an offering that's providing food and goods to those in need given the COVID epidemic, and we need development help! 
  
  For background, Intellihelp matches those in need with those who can give with 100% peer-to-peer donations of essential food and OTC medications. 
  
  Traction to Date: 
  -In 3 weeks the user base is already over 50,000 people in the US (through a FB group) 
  -This could turn into a decentralized version of Red Cross / or the Uber of P2P giving 
  
  Askers are mostly single women with children, elderly, and lower income folks who are isolated in their homes. In helping to facilitate these transactions, Intellihelp helps people survive.  
  
  To help millions more, we need technical talent to develop this platform for scale. If youâ€™re interested in helping, reach out to learn more about the product requirements!
