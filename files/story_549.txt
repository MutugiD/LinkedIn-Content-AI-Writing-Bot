Every step change function to grow in my professional career took a huge jump into an unknown situation that I had to ask for or make happen.  
  
  It was scary. I worried about failing. But I did it anyway.  
  
  I wanted to launch Uber Eats in Europe, so I applied to the Madrid GM job knowing I couldn't get it (not fluent in Spanish!), but it got me on the phone with a recruiter, I told them how I could help them, and one more conversation later I was on a plane to Amsterdam. 
  
  I wanted to lead an Ops team, so I took a role at Uber Freight before we had titles, salaries, roles or even a functioning app. I had no certainties, but I took the risk and 6 months later was leading our Carrier Ops team. 
  
  I quit Uber with nothing lined up.  
  
  I took a chance asking for a part-time role for a Series A start-up and worked only 25 hours per week making more than my Uber salary. 
  
  I then left my cushy consulting life to start Mylance because I'd always wanted to start and run my own company, and I loved helping people work for themselves and get multiple income streams. 
  
  You never know how a leap of faith will work out, but it's the only way to make a step-change in your work life, and there's no matter time to do it than right now. 
  
  (or to kick off 2022!)
