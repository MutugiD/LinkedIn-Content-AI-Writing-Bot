I got asked today in an interview how I knew it was time to start a business. 
  
  I gave an answer about how I felt I had enough experience, I had a lot of success at Uber, I found something I was passionate about, and I found a good business opportunity with a large market and problem. 
  
  The truth is, there's no  right  time to start your own business. And if you're waiting for  that great idea  then you're probably never going to get started. 
  
  Starting a business is about putting one foot in front of the other and just doing it. Deciding that no matter what, you want to build something, and nothing is going to deter you from that goal. 
  
  My mantra was  just get started  and then each day  do ONE thing that moves the business forward. 
  
  That helped me get through the tough days and tough times, and I'm so happy I did.
