RESPONSE:

The New Year is a time for reflection, and for many, the time to make a change. For me, that choice was made long ago and remains the same today.

I used to work in Corporate at Uber. My total annual compensation was $180,000. I was in meetings for 6 hours per day and worked an average of 65 hours per week. My hourly rate was $56.

I now work on my own as an expert consultant. My total annual compensation is $310,000. I'm in meetings for 1 hour per day and I work an average of 30 hours per week. My hourly rate is $210.

The choice is entirely up to you, but for me, the decision was an easy one.
