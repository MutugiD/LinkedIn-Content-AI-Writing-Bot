Six years ago, I took the leap and joined Uber. With a little bit of advice from an experienced colleague, I decided to go for it and it has changed the trajectory of my career. From managing North Carolina markets, to launching UberEATS and Uber Freight, to independent consulting for start-ups, and now starting my own business, Uber opened up so many opportunities to me both professionally and personally. If you're asked to make a big leap in your career, don't be afraid to do so. You never know how much could be gained from taking the leap.
