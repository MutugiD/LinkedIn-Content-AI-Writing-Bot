It's 28 months since I incorporated Mylance as a C-Corp in Delaware. It's been incredibly difficult and rewarding and amazing and challenging. 
  
  Last month was our best revenue month ever, and we've already beat our March revenue six days into April. 
  
  I think it's true what they say: growth happens slowly and then all at once. It’s been a slow, grueling process in building this business, and the hardest thing I've ever done. 
  
  But at no point did I ever consider giving up. I knew why I was doing it and I knew there was a big problem to solve. And now we’re rounding a very important corner, and our trajectory is incredibly exciting.  
  
  There's no smoke signal that tells you when to start a business, and there's no tried and true playbook for how to do it. It's putting a stake in the ground to say  I'm doing this now  and push it forward with relentless conviction every single day.
