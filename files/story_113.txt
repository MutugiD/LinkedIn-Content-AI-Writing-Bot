When I'm asked about my first consulting client, I often tell folks that I got lucky. 
  
  I do think I was fortunate, but in hindsight, I also set myself up for success. 
  
  I reached out to 11 people on LinkedIn to find my first client. 
  
  The first 10 said  no. 
  
  My guess is, a lot of people would stop right there and say  this isn't working.  And they wouldn't be wrong, it wasn't working. But that doesn't mean it would continue to not work. 
  
  The 11th person was open to a conversation, and that ended up being my first client. 
  
  Who I billed at $250 / hr at 25 hours per week. 
  
  And all of a sudden, I had a ton of confidence and excitement around my consulting business. 
  
  Sure I got lucky that their needs exactly met my expertise. 
  
  But I put myself in a position where they could say yes. I put myself out there. I didn't stop with the initial rejections. And I kept going until I got a  yes. 
  
  As a founder, I deal with this all the time now. I got told  no  by 145 investors, while 10 said yes. Those 10  yes's  filled out my Angel round. But getting told no 145 times was absolutely brutal. 
  
  There are no handouts in this life.  
  
  And there isnâ€™t with consulting either. Consulting is running a business, which we all know isn't easy.  
  
  It takes grit, hustle, and rejection. It takes overcoming fear and imposter thoughts, which we ALL have.  
  
  The reward is there *if* you're willing to put in the time and effort, and not give up when it gets hard.  
  
  And when you have a successful business, only you will know the hard work, grit, and commitment it took to get there.
