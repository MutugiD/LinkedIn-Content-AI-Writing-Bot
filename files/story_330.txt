As a founder, I'm always reminding myself of the wins, accomplishments, and progress. I constantly catch myself thinking about  the success down the line. 
  
  In reality, that success is every day. Starting the business I've always wanted to, working for myself, and running a business that genuinely helps people. That's the success, not any financial or PR moment that might come at the end of this. 
  
  The process of building this company is the fun part, and I'm doing my best trying to enjoy it.
