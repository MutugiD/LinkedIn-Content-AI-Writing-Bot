Fear is real. Fear of failure. Fear of success. It holds so many back from doing what they want to be doing.  
  
  And it's fair - doing something on your own, or changing your situation requires you to put yourself out there. It's scary, and it comes with all kinds of rejection. 
  
  For me, I write out the worst case scenario. Maybe I'll have unhappy customers, disappoint my employees, or feel bad about myself if I fail. Can I handle that? I've decided I can. 
  
  When you look back, would you rather stay comfortable in the status quo of your current situation, or take a risk knowing that you might fail, but you'll learn a lot along the way, and with hard work and perseverance, it's likely to work out one way or another? 
  
  The choice is yours, and you're making it every single day.
