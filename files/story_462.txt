I love helping folks become freelancers. It enables you to work for yourself, set your own rate, be your own boss, work across multiple clients, and manage your work life with intention. 
  
  If you're unhappy or feel underpaid in your current job, feel you're more efficient than the average person, and are self motivated, this might be a great path for you. 
  
  You can use your professional experiences to find clients and work for yourself. Message me and let's talk through it - it's more doable than you think!
