i've made $40k one hour expert network calls (glg, third bridge, coleman, ridgetop research, guidepoint, etc.) tips maximize earnings: 1. raise rate. started $250/hr $1,000/hr. tell get fewer calls, maybe will, doubt got 1/4th number calls, end ahead. 2. let pro-rate time. blocked hour call, get paid it. 3. apply projects area expertise. get it, wastes time. 4. get one area expertise, answer quickly. standard response area expertise save time. 5. ask group call bunch clients, ask many clients are, get paid per client joins. incentivized share group setting could get paid way individual calls. 6. answer questions feel comfortable. say want confidential info they'll ask anyways. keep boundary decline answer. else would add?
