The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

When we launched UberEATS in Miami, we were very concerned about Amazon Restaurants because they were Amazon. We spent quite a bit of time researching their offering to compete against them. Three years later, they’re shutting down.  
  
  If you’re launching a business that competes against a mammoth, don’t be overly worried. Out-strategize and out-execute them, and you may just be fine. You don’t know what resources they’re throwing at the problem, you don’t know where it sits on their priority list, and you certainly should not assume just because they’re successful at one thing, means they’ll be successful at all things. Don’t be afraid to go up against the big player - move fast, work hard, hire amazing talent, and you’ll have a good chance to win

==========

RESPONSE:

When UberEATS launched in Miami, the team were concerned about Amazon Restaurants, but they decided to invest a great deal of time in research of the competition. Years later, the Amazon Restaurants service ended a notable victory for UberEATS. Going up against a big player can be daunting, but the lesson here is that by moving fast, working hard, and hiring talented people, you're more likely to succeed than succumbing to the intimidating presence. Don't hesitate to compete against the giants - you might just surprise yourself!
