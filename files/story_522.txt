I made 3 costly mistakes when I started consulting.  
  
  These mistakes cost me a time, money, and a lot of energy. Learn from me so you can avoid them: 
  
  1. I marketed myself as an “Operator that used to work at Uber.”  
  
  Operations at Uber was a crucial part of the company, and I’d done some interesting things. But nobody outside of Uber knows what “Operations” really means.  
  
  So, I learned over time I had to narrow my niche and come up with a different way to communicate the value I add. 
  
  As a consultant today, I market myself as an automation expert that enables your marketplace to scale through product and process instead of headcount.  
  
  I target early-stage, logistics marketplaces. It seems narrowly focused, but there are hundreds of companies in that niche. And I only need 2-3 clients at one time to earn $25k / month. 
  
  2. I billed my first client hourly. 
  
  I kept a timesheet that had to be approved daily. The client was afraid to ask me things because I was “expensive” and I was incentivized to be inefficient with my work.  
  
  I never made this mistake again. 
  
  3. I didn’t structure my life as a business owner. 
  
  It felt cool to work 3-4 hours per day, make great money, and not have to go into an office or really report into anyone.  
  
  But after a few weeks, I felt lost. I missed structure and I didn’t have a community.  
  
  Creating structure for yourself (I came up with routines that worked for me) and finding likeminded colleagues is crucial especially if you’re ambitious and enjoy working hard!
