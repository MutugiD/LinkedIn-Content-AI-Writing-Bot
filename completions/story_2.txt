It's always a challenge to find the right balance when talking to a potential client. You want to give them enough information to know that you can help them, but not so much that you give away your most valuable knowledge for free. When I had my first call with a customer recently, I was faced with the same dilemma. 

The customer asked me if I had given away too much, and if I was being too nice. My answer was simple: No, you're not too nice. But your experience and skillset IS valuable. So, how do you find the balance between selling them on your abilities, but also holding back the valuable info they should pay for? 

The best way is to do a lot of listening. Ask smart questions about their business to show that you know what you're talking about. You can also drop a few tidbits from your experience to demonstrate that you understand the topic at hand. For example, "When I was at Uber, we thought about it this way." 

When you ask the right questions and follow up with a compelling proposal that summarizes the company's challenges and how your experience can help solve them, you're in great shape. That's one way to make sure you don't give away too much and still make a good impression.
