If COVID taught us anything, it's that having one single source of income is not secure - in fact it's the riskiest position we could put ourselves in. 
  
  Many of us have been taught from the beginning: go get a  stable  job and move up the ladder. 
  
  The thing is, that company isn't committed to you like you are to them. One thing happens in the world and they drop that commitment like it never happened. 
  
  More and more people are spinning up side hustles these days, especially since COVID as millions got laid off from their  secure  jobs. 
  
  There are a million ways to make money in addition to a salaried job, and the easiest I'd argue is selling your experience to help out a company on the side. You are the product. And your product is ready to go from years of learning and experiences. If you're wondering  can I consult?  and you have a few years of experience under your belt, you 100% can do it. In fact, it's easier than you think!
