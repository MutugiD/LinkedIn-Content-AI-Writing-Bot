Since founding Mylance in early 2020, we’ve been a remote team. I hadn’t met a single one of my team members in person.  
  
  This past week I took the Mylance team to our first ever in-person offsite.  
  
  Getting together in person wasn’t easy. With a global team, it took a lot of effort and money to get everyone together, not to mention the challenge of asking folks to leave their family, friends, and pets for a number of days. And we still couldn't get everyone together. 
  
  But, we knew it was important. In-person connections far surpass anything that can be done via Zoom, and those connections make building this company far more enjoyable. 
  
  For the first time ever, we could have casual in-person chats. We could easily brainstorm and share ideas. We could catch up personally and bond over shared interests. 
  
  I knew how important this time was. Not just to align on the path forward for the business, but much more importantly bond with each member of the team. 
  
  I’m incredibly thankful for the opportunity to work alongside these passionate, talented individuals, and continue building in the spirit of helping professionals work for themselves in a flexible, fulfilling way.
