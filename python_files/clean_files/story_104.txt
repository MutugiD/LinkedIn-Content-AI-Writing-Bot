negotiating used make nervous. now, love it. here’s reframed myself: first time negotiated myself, got $250 / hr, $25k / month consulting client. terrified. didn’t want lose deal, also wanted get thought deserved. felt like really difficult position. now, look forward it. think negotiating fact-finding mission: i’m trying learn much possible side. learn asking curious questions. also make sure feel heard. repeat hear back them. sometimes don’t quite right, correct me. also label hear them. “it seems like you’re tight budget.” again, correct me. i’m right, validate it, they’ll feel heard. learning everything side, suggest solutions work us. usually, there’s overlap want, asking questions, easily find overlap. lastly, i'll go conversation prepared. know floor. know “good” would look like me. anchor high, ask questions, never negotiate myself. also know need okay walk away. know it’s better make deal agree one i’ll regret. big shout christopher voss book “never split difference” helped change entire perspective negotiating, changed life book i’ve read!
