Getting expert network calls from Coleman, GLG, Ridgetop Research, and similar firms? 
  
  It's cool right? You get paid $1,000+ / hr for your expertise.  
  
  But that's really just a taste. Those calls are great, but they're unpredictable. An hour here and there is nice, but doesn't move the needle. 
  
  But it does prove to you that your knowledge and experience is valuable. 
  
  Now think about taking that knowledge and experience, and growing a sustainable consulting business bringing in $20k / month. 
  
  That's the reality for you. That's the opportunity. The demand is there. You just have to go out there and get it.
