I worked at Uber in Operations and Launch for 4.5 years from 2014 to 2018.  
  
  It was a great experience, but after a while I felt burnt out, under valued, and like I'd reached my ceiling. So I quit.  
  
  I wanted to explore starting a company, and needed to pay the bills in the meantime. So I sought out part-time consulting work. And my life changed forever.  
  
  I found my first client from my LinkedIn messages, and quickly built up my independent consulting business up to $25k / month working only 25 hours per week.  
  
  I became incredibly passionate about this way of working. It was so powerful! 
  
  So I founded Mylance so that everyone can work for themselves, part-time, make great money, and add value to incredible companies. 
  
  To me, one single source of income is scary and powerless. Monetizing your knowledge and experience through consulting gives you the power back of your earning potential and time.
