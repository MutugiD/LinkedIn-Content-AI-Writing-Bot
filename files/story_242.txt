I had this story in my head: I'm supposed to go to a good school, get a good job, move up the ladder, get a better title and a better salary, and retire at ~65. 
  
  Where I found myself at 28 was in meetings from 9am to 6pm every single day, and enjoying about ~15% of my job.  
  
  I decided life was too short to be unhappy so much of my week, and that I was willing to take a bet on myself. 
  
  Yes, I have privilege to have the savings to do this, but I also worked my butt off to build up those savings, so it's a combination luck, privilege, and discipline. 
  
  Quitting was scary. It pierced my idea of what I was  supposed  to be doing. 
  
  I didn't know if I'd succeed on my own. But I had a safety net: I bet I could go back to a corporate job, and thus my  worst case scenario  would be back to where I was. I decided I could handle that and it was worth the risk. 
  
  We all have a story in our heads of what we're  supposed  to do, how much money we  should  be making, how much we  need  to be working, and what our title  should  be at a certain time in our lives. 
  
  Check that story you tell yourself, and see how much of it is really true. 
  
  It's only once I quit my job and realized how much opportunity was out there for me did I realize the strength of the story I had been telling myself, which liberated me.  
  
  Now I'm onto my next story: what is the life of a founder, how well is my business  supposed  to be doing, how much  should  I work. It never ends; it's a constant practice in creating the life for myself that I truly want, enjoy, and am fulfilled by.
