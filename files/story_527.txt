I had no idea I could consult in Operations. In fact, most people told me I couldn't.  
  
  But, I wanted to try anyways. I didn't want another full-time role after Uber, but I thought I could help companies part-time given my learnings.  
  
  I'll be honest: with my first client I got lucky. I didn't know what I was doing, I didn't have a refined niche or a great proposal, and I certainly didn't have a lot of confidence.  
  
  But what I did have that got me across the finish line was the willingness to put myself out there, ask for what I wanted, and be okay getting told  no. 
  
  It helped I felt like I didn't have a lot to lose: if they said  no,  I'd be right back where I was. And if they said yes, this could fund my life while I worked to start the company I'd always wanted. 
  
  I shot high: I asked for $287 / hr. They said  no!  But they came back with $250 / hr at 25 hours per week. 
  
  And all of a sudden I had part-time work that was over 2x my Uber salary, free time, and flexibility that I'd always wanted. 
  
  There's nothing special about me. The difference is, I was willing to put myself out there and be okay with a  no.  And it changed my life forever.
