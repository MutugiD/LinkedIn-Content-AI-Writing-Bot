When I tell people that Uber Freight became a $1B brand in two years, they're often surprised. They think it’s because of Uber’s deep pockets and hefty investments. The truth is, the magic was a little more subtle than that. 

The first two steps we took had nothing to do with money. We went to truck stops in Dallas, Texas and spoke to hundreds of truck drivers. We asked them questions about their struggles, took detailed notes, and compiled our findings. This allowed us to gain valuable insights into what our product should look like and how to best serve our users. 

We also did things that didn’t scale. We manually moved freight loads so that we could understand the complexities and nuances of the process. This gave us an opportunity to build relationships that would be invaluable when the tech was ready. 

At the end of the day, it’s not how much you have that matters. Sure, having the resources to hire talented people is great, but there’s no substitute for understanding your users and creating tech that they’ll actually use.
