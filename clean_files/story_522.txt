made 3 costly mistakes started consulting. mistakes cost time, money, lot energy. learn avoid them: 1. marketed “operator used work uber.” operations uber crucial part company, i’d done interesting things. nobody outside uber knows “operations” really means. so, learned time narrow niche come different way communicate value add. consultant today, market automation expert enables marketplace scale product process instead headcount. target early-stage, logistics marketplaces. seems narrowly focused, hundreds companies niche. need 2-3 clients one time earn $25k / month. 2. billed first client hourly. kept timesheet approved daily. client afraid ask things “expensive” incentivized inefficient work. never made mistake again. 3. didn’t structure life business owner. felt cool work 3-4 hours per day, make great money, go office really report anyone. weeks, felt lost. missed structure didn’t community. creating structure (i came routines worked me) finding likeminded colleagues crucial especially you’re ambitious enjoy working hard!
