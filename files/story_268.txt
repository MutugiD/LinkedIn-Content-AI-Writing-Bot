Slowly, the dominoes are falling. You don't need to be in specific city, you don't need to be in an office, and you don't need to be working 9-5. 
  
  You also don't need to dedicate all of your time to one company. You can work across companies, enjoy the work you do, add value, and make way more money than if you isolated yourself to one company. 
  
  Also, as a part-time contributor, you significantly decrease dealings with politics and bureaucracy at the company.  
  
  Working at only one company is like holding only one stock. Why limit your earning potential instead of diversifying?
