Over my first year and a half freelancing, I averaged over $20,000 per month. Since then, Iâ€™ve been helping others start their freelance businesses. 
  
  To that end, Mylance has a three week bootcamp that teaches you everything you need to know to launch your freelance business.  
  
  This includes honing your niche, setting your rate, finding and pitching clients, and setting up your business properly, in addition to live feedback and sessions with experts: freelance accounting, executive coaching, personal branding, negotiation, and more. 
  
  Because it's so hands on with myself and our coaching experts, we have to charge quite a bit to make it work. 
  
  We're building out a lower cost offering that gives you a similar offering: playbook to launch your freelance business, answers to all the questions you have about freelancing, access to experts, weekly webinars, a community of talented freelancers, and access to freelance projects for a lower cost, monthly subscription.
