After years of working for someone else, I made the really hard decision to quit my job at Uber and go out on my own. 
  
  Doing that highlighted how valuable my skills were in the open market, and other ways I could make money: 
  
  1. I bought a tiny Ecommerce business and learned what it was like to run that. I automated the backend and sold it for 4x what I bought it for. 
  
  2. I started a blog. It went nowhere. 
  
  3. I reached out to people asking if i could help them part-time, and launched a 6-figure consulting business in 25 hours per week. 
  
  4. I started a travel tech company with two friends. We never got to our first customer. 
  
  5. I placed folks in my network at tech companies for a recruiting fee. 
  
  6. I helped friends launch their consulting businesses and eventually started Mylance 
  
  I felt so consumed by my job in tech. It took up all my energy. But once I left, I realized the opportunity out there. And now, I'm never going back.
