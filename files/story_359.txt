My goal as a consultant was to make the most money in the least amount of time. More free time for me, right? 
  
  To do that well, I had to find the company that was the best fit for my skillset and experiences. It wasn't just about finding a client, it was about finding a great client that NEEDED what I brought to the table.  
  
  To do this will, I had to get super niche in my offering that differentiated me from others. When I did find a company with that exact need, it was a home-run: they paid well and I could add a ton of value to them. 
  
  This coming Monday 4/5 at 5pm PT I'll be leading a free Masterclass on this exact topic!
