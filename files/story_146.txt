Every day building a company I face a different fear. 
  
  And every single one I have to overcome to keep moving, learning, and growing. 
  
  I fear employees won't want to join my company. 
  
  That customers will be disappointed in our product. 
  
  That an investor will reject me. 
  
  I also know that if I didn't have these fears. That if everything was easy, that I wouldn't be pushing my own boundaries. 
  
  And as an ambitious person, I have to be doing that. I want to be doing that.  
  
  And so I do my best to look in mirror, figure out what I'm scared of, and go do it anyways.
