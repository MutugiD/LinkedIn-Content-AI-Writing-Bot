So many people told me I couldn't work part-time in Operations.  
  
  It didn't make sense to me. Why not? If I could help a company with my experience, why did it matter so much if I was part-time or full-time? 
  
  So, I tested the waters. And it worked. My first client was a venture-backed, Series A start-up that hired me at 25 hours per week and $250/hr. It was incredible. And it wasn't a fluke. It kept happening. 
  
  The keys for me were: 
  
  1. Find companies whose problems related directly to my experience. I could solve a specific issue for them, and help them avoid costly mistakes. 
  
  2. Go in confidently asking for a rate I was excited about. There's no structure for consulting. Ask for what you want, and work with the client to come to a rate and scope that works for both of you. 
  
  3. Keep at it. Of course I got rejected a lot. I probably  won  1 in 5 clients I talked to. Maybe. That's okay. That ONE client funded my entire life and then some. And when I had two, I had a huge month. Rejection is part of the job. Get used to it. It means you're pushing the boundaries. 
  
  In 2022, I'm working to make my work life work for me. And part of that, is helping you make your work life work for you. 
  
  Been wanting to work part-time and have flexibility in your work-life? Shoot me a note - I'm happy to help.
