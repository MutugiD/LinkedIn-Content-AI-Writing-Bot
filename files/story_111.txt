What others might perceive as a  great career  might be boring to you. 
  
  Only you know what's right and when you need to make a change, take a chance, or move on to something new. 
  
  It's that burning desire inside your body. And it's not going to leave you until you satisfy it. 
  
  Satisfying it might take a ton of courage.  
  
  It could mean leaving that stable, high-paying job.  
  
  It could mean working late nights and weekends to get your side project or consulting business off the ground.  
  
  It could mean alienating some family members or friends.  
  
  It could mean disrupting the status quo you have in your head, or what you've been taught to want your whole life. 
  
  It's no small thing. In fact, it's a huge deal. 
  
  But you also know deep down when it needs to happen. 
  
  What's worse: doing it and having a rough go, or never doing it at all?
