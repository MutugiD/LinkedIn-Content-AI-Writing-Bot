Having done quite a few expert network calls (GLG, Coleman, Ridgetop, Guidepoint, etc.) over the past few years, here's what I've learned: 
  
  1. Get a high hourly rate. Don’t do anything for less than $300, and often if you do a few, you can go as high as $1,000/hr or more. Raise your rate consistently. 
  
  2. Don’t share anything they can’t find publicly. They’ll say they don’t want it, but they will likely ask anyways. Always feel free to decline to answer a question 
  
  3. Ask for 1 hour minimum for your time. Don’t let them pro-rate the session (unless it goes over an hour). You blocked off the hour and should get paid for the whole hour 
  
  4. If you don’t think the topic applies to you, don't bother filling out the form. It’s a waste of your time as they likely have hundreds of people they're asking about the same topic. 
  
  Otherwise, give it a shot and see if you can make some side income!
