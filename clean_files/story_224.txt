founded mylance 2.5 years ago. re-launch mylance today, first 4 things iâ€™d get ground: 1. talk many target customers possible. ask open-ended questions pain points, record calls, listen intently take notes. 2. launch landing page free offer (e.g., newsletter, community, playbook, etc.) surrounding heard customer interviews start collecting emails. 3. collected emails, jump call customer validate needs. 4. start community (so could talk customers) sell product solve one biggest needs. note: need actually built product already. i'm validating they'd pay it. validation first. product building second. founders: would offer tweaks above?
