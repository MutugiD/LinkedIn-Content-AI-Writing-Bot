Going out on your own is hard. There's no silver bullet to success and there are often a lot of imposter thoughts. 
  
  But it's also lucrative: 44% of independent consultants say they earn more than with a traditional job. 
  
  And even more importantly, the flexibility and ownership is unparalleled: these people are not going back: 60% of new solopreneurs agree that there is no amount of money that would convince them to take a traditional job.
