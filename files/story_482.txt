I’m boarding a flight from SF to DC. It’s Monday morning at 8am. The plane is slightly delayed, but it’s no big deal. I’m on #United in group 3. As I move up in line to board, they start putting bag tags on roller boards. As they go to take my bag, I ask if the overheads are full. I get back “I don’t know, I’m not on the plane.” I ask if I can bring mine on the plane to hopefully find a spot. She says “go ahead.” I get on the plane and she is now in the front greeting passengers. She takes my bag tag from my bag as I tell her I’m fairly confident I can make room. She says, “I hope you don’t, and you sit on it the entire flight.”  
  
  I say a sarcastic “I hope so too.” I get on board, and there are at least 20 spots open for large carry-on bags. I take one easily and take my seat. Dozens of other people behind me are murmuring asking why they checked the bags when many bins are empty.  
  
  In your business, if you treat your customers like this, they’ll remember. It’s not about the 20 extra minutes to collect your bag. These customers feel lied to. They feel deceived. The difference between this treatment on United and one on Southwest is night and day. It makes a difference, and I’ll choose to partner with the “nicer” business any day of the week.
