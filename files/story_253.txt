We saved the average consulting $21,000 on their taxes this year. After working with 50+ independent consultants this tax season, we've identified the top 3 ways you can save money for your business of one: 
  
  1. Tax structure - there's a lot of LLCs that should be S Corps, and some S Corps that should be C Corps, and it's not always one-size-fits-all or that one structure is perfect forever 
  
  2. Expenses - not writing off everything related to their business, if it's an ordinary and needed expense and related to your business, write it off! 
  
  3. Maximizing any and all applicable tax savings plans - HSAs and FSAs are great to use for medical expenses, DCAP (Dependent Care Assistance Plans) for childcare expenses, etc. 
  
  If you're not taking advantage of these, you're missing out, big time.
