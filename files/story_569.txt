After college, I did was I thought I was supposed to do. I got the best job I could. Since then, I've pushed the boundary and threw the  safe  path out the window. 
  
  I quit my management consulting firm to join a fast paced start-up. 
  
  I took on the challenge of launching Uber Eats knowing if it didn't go well I'd probably get fired. 
  
  I joined the Uber Freight team before we had an app or a real business with the  hopes  it could be something. 
  
  I quit Uber to go out on my own without having anything lined up. 
  
  I wound down my lucrative consulting business to found my own tech company. 
  
  And now I'm betting everything on myself and my team. 
  
  I'd always wanted to run my own business. And now I get to do that every day. 
  
  It's not glamorous. It's not easy. But it pushes the boundary for me.  
  
  It's what I want to be doing and it's the hardest challenge I can take on right now. And I believe in myself that long term this will be a success and this is the path I need to be on. 
  
  And for that opportunity, I'm incredibly thankful. 
  
  Happy Thanksgiving from me and our team at Mylance ðŸ¦ƒ
