This cold outreach started so well. It started out flattering and that she really cared about our mission at Mylance. 
  
  And then it went downhill. She shared what every other person that reaches out to me says.  We provide services in blog and article writing, SEO, ... 
  
  I immediately stopped reading. There are thousands that provide this exact service. What makes her different than anyone else? 
  
  As a freelancer trying to contract with a company, you need to differentiate yourself. There are a few ways you can do this: 
  
  1. Get super niche  
  2. Point to impressive accomplishments you've had with other companies 
  3. Help me understand the tangible impact you can make on my company 
  
  Whatever you do, this cold outreach isn't going to get you very far. It's a numbers game yes, but the more curated and differentiated your message is, the better return you're going to have on your outreaches.
