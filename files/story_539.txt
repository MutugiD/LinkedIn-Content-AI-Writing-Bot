I find it so hard to niche down.  
  
  But by not niching down, my value prop is weak. 
  
  Of course I don't want to narrow my funnel. I want to attract the most customers. So for Mylance, I want to help ANY professional launch and grow their consulting business. 
  
  That might be a compelling statement, but it doesn't talk to YOU. Here's how I could change it. Going way more narrow, I could say I help ex-Uber Operations professionals launch $10k per month consulting businesses.  
  
  Now my pool is much smaller, but for those it applies, this sentence SPEAKS to you. And how many people does that hit? If I help 1,000 of those people launch their businesses and charge $2,500 each, my business just made $2,500,000. Not bad. 
  
  For your consulting business, the same thing applies. If you go in as a  marketplace expert.  That's great and applies to hundreds of companies.  
  
  But you don't  speak  to any of them directly. Now if you're an expert at helping ridesharing start-ups expand geographically, you'll speak to fewer companies, but for the ones in that category, you'll resonate incredibly well. 
  
  And how many clients do you need to hit your goals? 2? 3? I averaged 2 clients per month and earned $25k / month consulting. 
  
  Niching down increases your perceived value, allowing you to charge more and resonate strongly with those customers.
