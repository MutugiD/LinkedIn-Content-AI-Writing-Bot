PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years. The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, 
making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. I will through the provided narrative in story, master 
and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will hold myself to the highest literary standards, and  my writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  


STORY:
================================

When I left Uber in 2018 to venture out on my own, I experimented a lot. One of those experiments was buying a small e-commerce website called VinoTwo. The product is a wine kit that includes a fun wine opener (the cork pops like a champagne cork), a vacuum pump to preserve the wine, a foil opener and an aerator.  
  
  I learned a lot and I automated the business: when someone buys a unit, there are zero action items on my end to fulfill the order. It turns out, the keys to grow this business (I believe) are targeted performance marketing and partnerships with other companies to sell for you (wineries, at events, etc.).  
  
  Now, I'm pursing other gigs and looking to sell this little business. This is a great way to dip your toe into e-commerce with a fully automated, fun product that's very cheap to run ($30 / month). 
  
  For this sale, you get ~80 units of inventory (~$2000 worth), the live website, manufacturer relationship, fulfillment center, social media accounts, and handed a business that is 100% fully automated.  
  
  Let me know if you're interested!

RESPONSE:

After years of writing professionally, I decided to venture out on my own. I bought a small e-commerce website called VinoTwo which sells wine kits. I learned a lot from this experience and automated the business so that when someone buys a unit, there are no action items required on my end to fulfill the order. 

I believe that the keys to growing this business are targeted performance marketing and partnerships with other companies to sell for you. Now, I am pursing other gigs and looking to sell this little business. This is a great opportunity to dip your toe into e-commerce with a fully automated, fun product that is very cheap to run. 

For this sale, you will get ~80 units of inventory (~$2000 worth), the live website, manufacturer relationship, fulfillment center, social media accounts, and a business that is 100% fully automated.
