When I left Uber and started consulting, many people thought it was impossible to freelance in Operations. Not knowing the possibilities, I gave it a try and landed a part-time project in Operations with my first client, a Series A company. I ended up with more clients than I could handle and so I referred them to my friends. I learned that sometimes people assume things to be true without trying and that the only thing true for sure is that if you don't think it's possible, then it's true for you. Take the risk, try something, and don't assume: who knows the possibilities!
