In this chapter of ‘Silencing the Imposter’, we explore how to use email and LinkedIn to book phone calls with potential clients. Crafting a compelling and personalized email can grab the reader’s attention and introduce yourself and highlight your value proposition. Connecting with decision-makers on LinkedIn can help you effectively propose a phone call to delve deeper into their business needs. During the call, make sure to listen deeply and showcase your expertise to identify potential opportunities for your services. Don't forget to follow up with a thank-you message and summarize your discussion and next steps. With consistent effort, you can take advantage of this proactive approach to discover new consulting opportunities - and silence the Imposter.
