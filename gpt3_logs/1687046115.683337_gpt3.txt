PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

I have some really exciting news:  
  
  I got promoted! 
  
  
  Okay, I didn't technically get promoted.  
  
  But it dawned on me: as a founder, I might never  get promoted  again. 
  
  While that's technically true, I can see and feel how much I've grown as a founder, a leader, and a peer to my colleagues.  
  
  And I want to celebrate that! 
  
  So while I still have the same title and still make a very bare-bones salary, I'd like to celebrate the growth I've had, the new skills I've acquired, and the areas I've improved. 
  
  And if you're a founder or solopreneur, I'd like to invite you to promote yourself and celebrate yourself along with me!

================================
END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story. 

SUMMARY: 




==========

RESPONSE:

Being a founder can be rewarding, but promotions are not always guaranteed. To celebrate and recognize the growth and the new skills I have acquired, I am inviting other founders and solopreneurs to join in this self-promotion celebration. Letâ€™s take this chance to acknowledge our efforts and realize the value of our accomplishments!
