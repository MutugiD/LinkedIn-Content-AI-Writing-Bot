When I started consulting, it felt like a complete black box and took me ~12 months of trial and error to feel comfortable and confident. 
  
  And I made a LOT of mistakes along the way. 
  
  We hear from our customers they want to skip that trial and error. So we wrote up a comprehensive playbook detailing the exact steps to launch and grow your consulting business. 
  
  Including how to: 
  
  1. Hone your niche 
  2. Find clients 
  3. Price your services 
  4. Set up your LLC 
  5. Scope out a project 
  6. Write up a great proposal 
  7. Negotiate and close 
  8. Contracts  
  
  ...and a ton more 
  
  I'm acutely aware of all the tech layoffs, and it seems like many folks are interested in working on their own instead of finding another W2 (or in addition to finding a W2!) 
  
  At Mylance we really want to do something to help, so we're thinking of releasing this playbook for a significant discount to folks who've been laid off recently. 
  
  Is that something you'd be interested in? Let me know in the comments below
