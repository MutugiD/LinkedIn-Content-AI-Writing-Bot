Our Wefunder is officially closed and the money ($84k) is in the bank!  
  
  Here's why I did it to fill out the round: 
  
  1. IMO you shouldn't have to be an accredited investor to invest in start-ups. This allowed anyone to invest as little as $100! (We also got a $30k check in there!) 
  
  2. Our customers could get a piece. Early Mylance customers were loving the product and wanted to get a piece of the action, so I wanted to give them the opportunity. Plus, what's a better signal than your own customers investing in your company? 
  
  To provide a bit of context, we raised ~$400k from Angels and one institution, and used this to get to the $500k number we wanted for the round. 
  
  For the $400k, I used my own AngelList syndicate (I set one up) that took no carry or management fees to simply collect everything easily and only put one spot on the cap table. 
  
  I'd like to extend a HUGE thank you to everyone who is supporting this journey. It's incredibly difficult and I couldn't do it without your love and support! 
  
  We're not fundraising for a while now (we have plenty of runway) and focused on building to empower professionals to live flexible, fulfilling work lives! 
  
  I provide monthly updates on the business here on LinkedIn, so follow me if you'd like to be kept in the loop!
