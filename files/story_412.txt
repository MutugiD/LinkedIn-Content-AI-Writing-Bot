Put yourself out there and put yourself out there some more. It's not easy and it comes with a lot of rejection and failure. 
  
  But it also opens up new opportunities that you never would have otherwise.  
  
  The worst that happens is you don't get a response, or you get a  no.  Can you live with that? Will your ego get shattered? 
  
  If you're not doing something you know deep down you want to, you're likely scared.  
  
  Write down the worst case scenario, put it in a drawer, and push yourself out there. I promise, your ego won't get shattered.
