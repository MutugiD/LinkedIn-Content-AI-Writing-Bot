When we launched UberEATS in Miami, we were very concerned about Amazon Restaurants because they were Amazon. We spent quite a bit of time researching their offering to compete against them. Three years later, they’re shutting down.  
  
  If you’re launching a business that competes against a mammoth, don’t be overly worried. Out-strategize and out-execute them, and you may just be fine. You don’t know what resources they’re throwing at the problem, you don’t know where it sits on their priority list, and you certainly should not assume just because they’re successful at one thing, means they’ll be successful at all things. Don’t be afraid to go up against the big player - move fast, work hard, hire amazing talent, and you’ll have a good chance to win
