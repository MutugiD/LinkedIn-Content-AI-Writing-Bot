When I started Mylance, I got a mix of advice telling me to either raise money to fast-track the success of the company, or to avoid raising money so I can remain the boss of my own business. All these wise words of advice made me realize that there is no one-size-fit-all approach when it comes to building a company. It is important to take into account advice from mentors and advisors, but ultimately I should decide what is best for my current situation and company.
