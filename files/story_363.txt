I'll be honest, I got lucky to get my first consulting client. I had no idea what I was doing, I didn't know how to pitch myself, I didn't know how much to charge, and frankly I was scared of putting myself out there. 
  
  But, I did anyway. I took a risk. I asked for $287 / hr and thought I'd get laughed out of the room. I didn't. In fact, it kicked off an incredible journey of working for myself, consulting with various start-ups. 
  
  Taking that leap. Quitting my job not sure of my next move. It's scary. It's hard. But I was tired of working for someone else. I was tired of being held back. I was over the politics and BS. I was sick of someone else telling me when it was time for a promotion. 
  
  I wanted to earn the true value I brought to an organization. I wanted more free time. I was ready to live life on my own terms. 
  
  I did. What was holding me back was the fear of going out on my own. Of failing. And once I got over that, it was the best decision I've ever made.  
  
  What's holding you back?
