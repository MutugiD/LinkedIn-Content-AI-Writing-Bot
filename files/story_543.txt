I couldn't take being in meetings all day. I couldn't take the politics and bureaucracy. And most importantly, I couldn't take the feeling that the value I created was way more than I was getting paid. And I was giving my all to the company.  
  
  That was how I felt in 2018 in my last year at Uber. I had built up a strong belief in my own abilities, and I decided I was ready to go out on my own. 
  
  I didn't line up another job. I didn't have a plan. I just quit. And I took time off, which was the most loving thing I could do for myself at that time. 
  
  And when I felt ready to work again, I put myself out there. I started a blog. I asked companies if I could consult for them part-time. I sold wine openers as part of an ecommerce company I acquired. I worked on a tech start-up with a few friends.  
  
  A lot of these things didn't pan out. But that didn't feel like failure. I was trying and learning. And that's exactly what I set out to do. 
  
  Then something stuck. I learned I could really help companies part-time, make a good living, and work only 20-25 hours per week. 
  
  And I learned I could help others do it. And I loved helping and coaching others.  
  
  So I started Mylance. Partially to solve my own problems as a consultant, and partially because I became incredibly passionate about part-time work, and I wanted to live and breathe helping others do the same. 
  
  The first step for me was realizing I wasn't fulfilled in my job, and that there was a whole other business world out there. When I left Uber, it was like the blindfold was taken off me. I saw an entire world of opportunity and SO many different ways to make money and add value.
