It's time to celebrate! 
  
  I put a lot of pressure on myself for outcomes. Outcomes are all that matter for a company. Users, revenue, growth, retention. But, those don't happen without the right process: form follows function. 
  
  You can't will revenue to grow, but you can certainly work your butt off to do the right things that hopefully have that result. 
  
  It's incredibly challenging as a founder, and crucially important to celebrate the  wins  along the way, even if they're not growth related. 
  
  For Mylance over the last 4 weeks we're celebrating: 
  
  1. New website (check it out! https://lnkd.in/gD9kuud) 
  
  2. Five new incredible team members Sahana Satish Charles Stern Benjamin Wordell Rebekah Bibee manav p thaker! 
  
  3. Kicked off with a dev shop to build our first native product 
  
  4. Revamped our Bootcamp that's getting incredibly high customer satisfaction scores (most sessions with a perfect +100 NPS!) 
  
  5. Completed our Angel-round fundraise of $500k 
  
  While the journey isn't an easy one, I love the opportunity to build this company every day, helping people find more fulfillment in working for themselves #onwardsandupwards
