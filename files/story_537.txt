I get all asked all the time how I find clients for my freelance consulting business. While I have a pitch of how I help start-ups, the main way I do it is by asking questions, specifically in my area of expertise.  
  
  I launched markets and automated manual processes at Uber. So I ask about that: 
  
  How do you think about scaling up your team without adding tons of headcount? 
  
  Are you thinking of more of a centralized growth strategy or having local teams?   How will you standardize your offering with local teams while benefitting from best practices in the different regions? 
  
  By asking good questions, I show potential clients that I A) have relevant experience, B) have done this before, and C) makes them realize how I can help their business, all without me pitching myself! People also love talking about themselves, so they'll feel good when they talk to you. 
  
  Have you used this tactic before? Any other tips to share to find clients?
