I wanted to find part-time work that could pay my bills while I started a company. 
  
  Here's what I did: 
  
  I reached out to 11 companies who seemed like they could benefit from my experience at Uber. Some of them had reached out to me on LinkedIn for a full-time role, so I just responded that I was open to part-time instead. 
  
  10 companies either ignored me or said  no. 
  
  That was discouraging. Rejection sucks.  
  
  One company said they were interested to learn more, and we jumped on a call. 
  
  That call led to an interview which led to a proposal and to my first client. 
  
  That client paid me $25k / month in 25 hours per week! Over double my Uber salary. 
  
  I put myself out there. I got rejected. I kept going, and I had a win. And that  win  more than exceeded my expectations for what I could make part-time. 
  
  Many others would have stopped after 5 or 7 or 9 rejections. 
  
  If you keep going and you learn on your way, you're going to have success. The key is to start in the first place.
