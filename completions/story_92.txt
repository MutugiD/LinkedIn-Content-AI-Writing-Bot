My journey as an entrepreneur has been an example that there is no one-size-fits-all approach and none of us have it all figured out. Instead, we have to take it one step at a time, put ourselves out there, be ready to make mistakes and learn from them as we continue on our journey. Good things happen when we take a leap of faith and keep pushing forward.
