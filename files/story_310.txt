Think you're a jack of all trades? You might be, But even if you feel like you are one, being a  jack of all trades  is no way find a consulting client. 
  
  I recently worked with Fadi Hindi to improve his niche and showcase his talents with his Mylance HQ. He went from an  Operations Expert  to  Enabling Series A and Series B tech companies to rapidly scale headcount while preserving culture and preventing hiring inflation. 
  
  Can he do other things? Absolutely. But we had find what set him apart. Here's his differentiator: 
  
  1. Took Box's Engineering Department from 250 to 550 
  2. Took Udemy's headcount from 500 to 1200  
  
  How many people can say that? Not many, and while his other experiences will help him add immense value as a consultant, this is his niche, and this is what will help him win a client. 
  
  His HQ is linked in the first comment if you'd like to take look for yourself.
