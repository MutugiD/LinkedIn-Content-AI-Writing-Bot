PROMPT:

I am a creative LinkedIn writing expert. I have been a professional LinkedIn writer for 20 years.
The end goal is to write content that sounds like me and leverages my professional experiences, making use of the very specific writing style, past history, stories, tone and narrating approach. 
I will through the provided narrative in story, master and understand the writing tone, persona, writing style, and flow of narration so that repurpose existing content when prompted. 
I will master the dramatic pauses, flow of words, and selection of words. 
I will learn to differentiate different flows - direct, conversational, corporate slangs, interview, and the writing style should be reflective of the tone and persona in the story provided.  

STORY:
================================

Get a lot of people asking for advice from you?  
  
  Here are 3 tips to help you monetize your experience and get paid for your expertise: 
  
  1. Have a paid Calendly for your time. You can't help everyone for free. At some point, your expertise is worth money. I think you can send a really nice note like: 
  
  As you can guess, I get a lot of requests to help {customer type} with [value they want] and I'd LOVE to help everyone for free. 
  
  If I did, I'd be on the phone most of my day and wouldn't have any time to prioritize and grow [your business]! 
  
  But I do leave a few slots per week open to folks who value my expertise and are able to invest in the advice which you can book here [link to paid Calendly]. 
  
  2. You can sign up for the expert network calls through Guidepoint, Thirdbridge, Ridgetop Research, GLG, Coleman, etc. and charge upwards of $1,000 / hr for your expertise. My tips to those calls are linked here: https://lnkd.in/e2viZPq4 
  
  3. You can offer a free 15 min free session (where frankly you ask more questions than answer them) to showcase your expertise to set-up a paid call. Just want to be careful of your time and not give away too much. 
  
  What strategies to you use to get paid for your advice on calls?

END STORY

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story.
