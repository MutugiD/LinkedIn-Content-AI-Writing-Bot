I knew I wanted to work for myself. For many years I tried side projects while I had a full-time job. I found it so hard to have the discipline to get home from a long day at work and work on the side project. 
  
  Nothing went anywhere. Project after project I abandoned after a few months. 
  
  I was completely absorbed in my full-time job. For a company that I loved, but a company that didn't love me.  
  
  Once I left, I realized how relatively unimportant I was. They were just fine without me.  
  
  After a few months off, I played around with new projects and I realize why I was failing. Any project from scratch is incredibly difficult to get off the ground. There is no silver bullet. You have to keep trying new things and working hard.  
  
  You have to grind it out. You see all the stories about the side hustles and projects that are making millions quickly. Those aren't the norm. The norm is months and years of hard work before you see any big results. 
  
  It's about getting started, and being consistent. If I can do it, you can too.
