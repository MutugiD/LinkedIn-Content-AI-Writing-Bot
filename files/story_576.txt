 What do I have to lose?  might be the most powerful sentence I've ever asked myself. It allowed me to close my highest paying consulting project (to date).  
  
  Here's how I used it: 
  
  When we got introduced to the CEO, we initially did a great job  scoping the project  by asking tons of curious questions about where the company was struggling, and identifying where we could help (I was working with a business partner whom I'd met at Uber Freight).  
  
  After our scoping call, it was clear the client would benefit a ton from our expertise, so we decided to go big. What did we have to lose?  
  
  We sent over a proposal asking for $40k per month. 
  
  Note: I’ve since learned to be specific with your number. $40k sounds made up. $41.7k sounds calculated. But, we didn’t know better at the time. 
  
  He came back asking for $30k (we were shocked!) and while that was incredible, we didn't have much to lose to ask for more. We told him we couldn't take a 25% discount from $40k (anchored him) but instead could do a 12% discount to $35,200. 
  
  It worked, and we closed the deal. Adding to everything, we wrote in the contract they had to pay us up front, and they agreed no problem. The moment he slid a check across the table to us for $35,200 for 30 days of part-time work, I nearly lost it. 
  
  My top learnings from this experience:  
  
  1. You never know what's possible until you ask 
  
  2. You might bring something far greater to the table than you realize 
  
  3. Consulting is freaking amazing because you can capture the true value you bring, not what an employer says you're worth
