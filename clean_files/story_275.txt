one key $20,000 project vs $5,000 one: super narrow consulting niche. might thinking you’re jack trades generalist. maybe are. that's great. well-rounded. i'm going ask put aside second. company needs specific talent solve specific problems. companies pay great money solve specific, pressing problems. companies don’t hire generalists solve specific problems. trouble narrowing niche?
