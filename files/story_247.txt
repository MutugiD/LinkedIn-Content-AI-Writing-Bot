When I first started consulting, I got lucky: my first client paid me $250 / hr (90% in cash, 10% in equity) for ~25 hours per week. 
  
  While the arrangement was amazing, I often woke up feeling off. 
  
  I didn't get feedback, I didn't have structure, and not having a  stable job  that I was used to felt weird. 
  
  Further, I felt alone. I wasn't truly part of the company, and very few of my friends were doing something similar.  
  
  I wish I had a community of people that were doing something similar.  
  
  And that's part of the reason we started the Mylance Community. Going out on your own is scary and lonely. But now you don't have to do it alone. In fact, you also get to be surrounded by experts in their fields: CPAs, lawyers, and Executive Coaches to help you navigate the challenges of consulting.  
  
  Even more, you get access to a project board of high-end consulting gigs to launch or grow your consulting business.  
  
  And, it's free (for now).
