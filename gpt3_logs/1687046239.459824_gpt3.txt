STORY:
================================

Uber Freight launched in 2016 and grew to a $4B valuation in 4 years. This business line has zero synergies with Uber's core business. 
  
  Here’s how it happened: 
  
  In early 2017 I moved out to SF to help launch Uber Freight. It was building a “from scratch” start-up within a billion dollar company.  
  
  Here’s what we did: 
  
  1. We did user research like any other company. We went to truck stops in Dallas, TX and spoke to truck drivers. We recorded all the conversations in a Google form. We reviewed answers weekly and found common threads. 
  
  2. We grew without a product. We moved loads manually in the early days using existing, antiquated software. We could see the good and bad about existing solutions, and we were getting users. 
  
  3. Uber acted basically as our “VC fund.” They would give us a small budget to hit a milestone. Once we did, we got more. Each year we’d pitch them asking for a new. While this was way easier than an actual VC round, we spent COUNTLESS hours preparing these decks. It wasn’t as easy as you might think. 
  
  4. While we had access to Uber’s resources, it was hard to take advantage. First, the customer segments do not overlap. At all. Uber Freight matches shippers and carriers. This has nothing to do with riders and drivers. It’s a B2B marketplace with long sales cycles. Secondly, Uber didn’t let us take really anyone from the core business. We couldn’t hire ANYONE. We had to hire externally to avoid disrupting the core business. 
  
  5. We stayed focused. Despite an absolutely enormous market, we focused only on 53’ dry van truckload freight in the US for YEARS. We easily could’ve expanded to flatbed and many other kinds, but we didn’t. There was a multi-billion dollar market in that one focus area alone, so we kept at it. 
  
  6. We hustled - we did whatever it took to onboard new customers. That including cold calling hundreds of new Freight carriers per day, and testing new ways to get them onboarded onto the app. We found that if we had a “good” load for them, they were likely to sign up. So we used the carrot method and called them, trying to get them to use the app for their second load. 
  
  Uber Freight was a startup trying to find product market fit just like any other pre-seed company! 
  
  We moved one load after another. We automated everything we could. We hustled and we pushed through tough challenges. It’s never easy. It’s just different levels of hard.

SUMMARY: 




==========

RESPONSE:

The launch of Uber Freight back in 2016 was a major success, culminating in a successful $4B valuation just four years later. This was no mean feat, as the Uber Freight business bore no synergies to Uber's core business and required a startup approach within the larger umbrella company. This included user research and conversations with truck drivers to understand needs, an initial reliance on antiquated software as well as carefully managed budgets from Uber itself and a deliberate focus on a single type of freight. Ultimately, it was the hustle and automation of processes that drove the success of Uber Freight and proved that success, even within a larger organisation, is attainable with the right know-how.
