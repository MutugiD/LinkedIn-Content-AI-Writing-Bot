In my career, I had to frequently ask for what I wanted to get the experiences I ended up having. This included launching UberEATS in Milan, launching Uber Freight in the US, launching a freelance consulting business, and starting my own company, Mylance.

  1) Know what we want 
  2) Make it happen 
  
  Here's a story of two leaps I took during my time at Uber, and while one was a failure, one resulted in an amazing experience, and helped me get to where I am today.
