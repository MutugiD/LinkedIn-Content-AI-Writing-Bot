To maintain $25k / mo in consulting revenue for my business, I found clients 6 ways: 
  
  1. My network 
  
  2. Curated email outreach 
  
  3. Marketplace platforms 
  
  4. Posting Linkedin content to generate inbounds 
  
  5. LinkedIn outreach (both cold and responses to companies / recruiters)  
  
  6. Slack communities 
  
  There's no one silver bullet.  
  
  You have to put in the work, get on the phone, and find clients with challenges where you directly add value. 
  
  To helps to first: 
  
  1. Nail your niche 
  2. Make your intentions clear 
  3. Set your goal for what  good  looks like 
  
  And then put yourself out there, jump on calls, and start learning.
