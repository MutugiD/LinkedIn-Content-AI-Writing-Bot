You no longer have to work for 45 years and then retire. I know what I was told: 
  
  1. Get into the best college you can 
  2. Graduate with a great degree 
  3. Go get a job / get experience 
  4. Move up the ladder to higher titles and salaries 
  5. Work your butt off for 45 years 
  6. Retire when you're 65 and then relax 
  
  What I learned I can actually do: 
  
  1. Get some good experience 
  2. Learn skills, invest in yourself, get confident in your abilities 
  3. Monetize your skills through any number of different possibilities including part-time jobs, consulting, creating, or starting your own business 
  4. Create a balanced, flexible work life for you that you love 
  
  What worked in the past doesn't need to be replicated today. The world has changed, and you can 100% build a work life that works for you. 
  
  It takes some guts. It takes some risks. But if you believe in yourself and your abilities, you know you'll make it work in the end.
