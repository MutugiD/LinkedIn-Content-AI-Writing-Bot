My former Uber colleague and I joined forces to deliver an unbeatable offer to our logistics clients â€“ the perfect combination of BD/Marketing and Operations/Automation knowledge. This ensured we could offer more value, and charge higher prices, up to the biggest deal of $35k/month for part-time work. Our partnership worked flawlessly because I trusted him wholeheartedly and our skillsets complemented one another. If you're looking to expand your offering, partnering with someone you trust may be the perfect option!
