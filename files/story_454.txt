It's much better to walk away from a bad deal than agree to one.  
  
  Your time is not free! Please don't help a company for free. (this does not apply to helping friends, please help your friends and family). 
  
  You have experiences and skills that you've worked hard and paid for in many ways.  
  
  Now, you can use what you've learned to negotiate a great deal. 
  
  Before you go into a negotiation, write down what you're trying to get out of it. Think about where you'd be happy to end up, and what concessions you're willing to make. Then pick your ideal scenario â†’ if you could write it up perfectly with no opposition.  
  
  Start there, and be very deliberate in how you move down. Do not negotiate against yourself, make them make a counter offer.  
  
  If you they come in too low, tell them you appreciate the offer, but unfortunately cannot accept it. They might negotiate against themselves! And never be afraid to say  no.   
  
  Once you agree, make sure to stay within the agreement. If you agreed to 5 hours per week and they're asking for 10 hours of meetings, kindly ask to revisit the deal. If they need more of your time, you're happy to let them pay for it!
