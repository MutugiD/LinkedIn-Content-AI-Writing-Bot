New consultants often want to  get a foot in the door  by charging a low rate to start off or worse, working for free. 
  
  This is crazy. 
  
  This would be like joining a company full-time and offering to work for free for the first 3 months while you get up to speed. 
  
  If a company brings you on as a consultant, it's because you're adding a unique value.  
  
  And your job is to get PAID for that value. 
  
  Many of our Mylance customers want to be earning $15k - $20k / month on the side. While very achievable, this means charging clients for the full value you bring.  
  
  It's not a time to be shy and ask them what they think they should pay you. And it's definitely not a time to work for a low rate or work for free. 
  
  Your experience is incredibly valuable. Go in confident. Ask for what you want. And get paid for your FULL value!
