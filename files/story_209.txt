Investors charging founders to vet their company is completely unacceptable.  
  
  I was outreached by US Angels who, when they shared their process with me, showed me they charge a $750-$950  deep dive screening session  fee. 
  
  I find this incredibly wrong, and shared this with the CEO of US Angels. I wrote: 
  
  I feel the need to share my feelings about this to protect myself and other founders. Charging founders money for a “deep screening  call is wrong. These founders are raising money (not trying to spend extra money) and are busting their tails to build companies, which we both know is incredibly hard.  
  
  Further, many companies will be a pass (that’s just the nature of investing) and thus you’re collecting money from the majority of companies that you will not give an investment. 
  
  If anything, it should be the other way around: that you pay for the opportunity to learn about the company and for the founder to share their time with you for the right to potentially invest in the company and profit from their hard work. 
  
  I hope as the CEO of US Angels you strongly consider this and remove the deep screening fee, and stop collecting money from founders. 
  
  Sincerely, 
  Bradley Jacobs 
  
  I hope no founder ever pays to be vetted by an investor, join a pitch competition, or anything similar.  
  
  Investors are lucky they get an opportunity to hear about your business and get time with you. Keep that mindset, and keep building.
