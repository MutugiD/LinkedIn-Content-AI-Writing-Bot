In surveying our 9 July Mylance bootcamp customers, on a scale from 0 to 10, we received two 9s and seven 10s for the value our bootcamp brings in helping our customers launch their freelance businesses. 
  
  I'm proud of our team for taking the feedback from our June customers, and incorporating for July to get these results. Feedback is a gift! 
  
  I couldn't be more excited about the path we're on. Onwards!
