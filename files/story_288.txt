Starting a company is the hardest thing I've ever done. At the beginning it felt like I was moving through sludge and so hard to see any progress. 
  
  I had many down days where I didn't feel like doing anything, and I would end up refining my cash flow model (for customers I didn't have yet) because it felt  productive.  It turns out, that was just me avoiding actually talking to real customers, to avoid the potential of being rejected or being told my idea sucks.  
  
  So I started making a plan the night before. If I didn't feel great, I would accomplish ONE thing that would move the business forward. And I stuck to it. So no matter how bad the day was, I accomplished that one thing. 
  
  Then, I created a list of accomplishments. This included incredibly small things like  bought a domain name  or  talked to 10 customers  or  made first version of the website live.  See that these are things I can control, not outcomes (like revenue targets). I'd go back to this list any time I was feeling down or like I wasn't making progress. 
  
  Many new entrepreneurs get stuck in this early phase, trying to find an idea to pursue, and spending time on things that don't matter (like making a beautiful logo or doing 20+ hours of research on a market). 
  
  The best thing you can do is put one foot in front of the other, and accomplish ONE thing every day that actually moves the business forward, no matter how big or how small.
