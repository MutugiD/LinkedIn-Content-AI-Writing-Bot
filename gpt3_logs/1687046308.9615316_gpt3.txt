STORY:
================================

The 3 crucial components of a great consulting niche: 
  
  1. One sentence that describes what you do and how you do it 
  
  2. Who you do it for (your ideal client) 
  
  3. Accomplishments to back up your offer that qualifies you to do it 
  
  A good example:  
  
  What you do and how you do it:  
  I build full-stack web applications in record time (in as little as two weeks), bringing your MVP to market in record speed. 
  
  Who you do it for (ideal client):  
  My ideal partner is a pre-product start-up with non-technical founders that have completed some fundraising, and needs a reliable engineering resource to bring their first product to market. I work with the founders to build their initial web platform, and can also help hire a full time CTO / build out a full engineering team. 
  
  Accomplishments (what qualifies you to do it) 
  1. In the first six months of 2022, I built the entire product for a Winter 22 YCombinator company from the ground up. Based on the MVP, the company raised $5.5 million in May 2022. 
  
  2. I founded a B2B tech start-up in November 2019. We had dozens of enterprise customers, $81K in ARR, and it was acquired in June 2021. 
  
  3. As a software developer at Uber, I launched Touchless Loads in only two weeks, which now saves the company over $9 million a year.

I will write a coincise summary of the story after processing, personalizing and mastering the flow of words, tone, persona and style of writing, and considering all facts of the story.
