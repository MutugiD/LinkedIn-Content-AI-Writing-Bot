If you're not uncomfortable in parts of your business life, you aren't pushing yourself.  
  
  Being uncomfortable is part of the game: 
  
  -Posting on LinkedIn 
  -Testing a new offer 
  -Asking for that promotion or a raise 
  -Taking on a project out of your comfort zone 
  -Networking with a stranger 
  -Asking for a $20k / month project 
  
  It's not easy. But it's required if you want to grow.  
  
  And the more you can get comfortable being uncomfortable, the more opportunities you'll have to take your professional life to the next level
