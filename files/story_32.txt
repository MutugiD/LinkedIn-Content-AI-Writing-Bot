The biggest move I ever made to up-level my career: I quit my job.  
  
  I loved being at Uber. But when I was there, I was wrapped up in it, making me completely blinded to the other opportunities outside the company. 
  
  Once I quit, I explored a ton and opened my eyes up to one simple fact: there are a ton of different ways to make money: 
  
  -I bought a tiny ecommerce business and sold online 
  -I made a few placements from my network at tech companies 
  -I started a blog 
  -I consulted 
  -I sold courses on how to consult 
  -I eventually started my own software company 
  
  I learned new skills. Met a ton of great people. And eventually got to where I'd always wanted: running my own business.  
  
  AND I used the money I was making from consulting to fund my life while I started my own company.  
  
  I never knew any of this was possible. And the only way I could find out was to quit, and explore.  
  
  It was scary, but I believed in myself. And very quickly I saw that I'd be just fine on my own.
