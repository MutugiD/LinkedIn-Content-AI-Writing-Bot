After years of working in the corporate world, I decided to take a leap of faith and venture into something new. My first experiment was buying a small e-commerce website called VinoTwo. It features a unique wine kit that includes a fun wine opener (the cork pops like a champagne cork), a vacuum pump to preserve the wine, a foil opener and an aerator. 

I took the time to learn and automate the business. Now, if someone purchases a unit, there are no tasks for me to fulfill the order. I believe that the keys to grow this business are performance marketing and partnerships with other companies. 

Now, I am looking to sell this little business. This is a perfect way to get into e-commerce with a fun product that doesn't require a lot of money to run. In this sale, you will get about 80 units of inventory (~$2000 worth) and the website, manufacturer relationship, fulfillment center, social media accounts, and a business that is 100% automated. 

If you are interested, please check out the website and the Exchange Marketplace. Plus, if you like the product, use the code sample30 for a 30% discount! This is a great opportunity for anyone looking to dip their toe into e-commerce.
