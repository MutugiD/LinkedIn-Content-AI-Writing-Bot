I hear it all the time.  Isn't freelancing only for designers and engineers? 
  
  For me, I made a lot more money freelancing in  Operations  than working in Operations at Uber. 
  
  Freelancing has certain connotations, but for me, it means working in a contract capacity to help a company achieve their goals. 
  
  My first client was a Series A self-driving company who wanted to stand up a restaurant delivery marketplace, but didn't have the Ops chops or know-how to do it. I helped them bring together the 3-sided marketplace over a number of months in a contract role to get it launched. 
  
  My second client was a pre-seed company looking to take their freight software that enabled brokerages, and launch to their first set of initial customers. I helped them with their go-to-market strategy to get off the ground. 
  
  I helped my third client with their Freight Agriculture business, aligning the product and sales teams on a launch for the shipper side of their business. 
  
  And with 5+ years of good experience, you likely can too. Just don't forget to hone your niche incredibly well. Going to a company telling them you do  Operations  won't get you anywhere :)
